//! GPU-resident paged weight cache: wraps `infr_core::pager::Pager`'s host-side LRU bookkeeping
//! with a fixed-slot VRAM arena, a small host-writable/GPU-readable LUT buffer, and upload
//! machinery through a caller-supplied REUSED pinned staging buffer (validated by
//! `tests/bandwidth_probe.rs` — a fresh staging buffer per call roughly halves throughput; see
//! that test's `fresh` vs `combined` columns. On this box the device-copy phase itself is nearly
//! free — ReBAR puts the staging buffer in device-local host-visible VRAM, so the bottleneck is
//! the host memcpy into it, not the subsequent `vkCmdCopyBuffer`).
//!
//! # Design (block-agnostic core, MoE plugs in today)
//! [`GpuPager`] only knows about uniform `slot_bytes`-sized blocks keyed by an opaque
//! `infr_core::pager::BlockId` — it has no idea a block is "an expert". The MoE integration
//! (`infr-llama`'s seam / this crate's `adapter.rs`) packs a `BlockId` from `(layer, role,
//! expert_id)` and calls [`GpuPager::ensure_resident`] with that block's mmap'd tensor bytes
//! before dispatching the id-indexed GEMV/GEMM through the LUT hop (the `PAGED` branch in
//! `shaders/native_gemv_id.comp` / `native_gemv_id_multi.comp`: `slot = lut[ids[slot]]`, scaled
//! onto the arena's 64-bit device address as `arena_addr + slot * slot_bytes` — see the `lut_host`
//! field's doc and `shaders/native_weight_addr.glsl`). A FUTURE dense layer-streaming policy
//! (NOT implemented here — see the task doc) would reuse this exact struct with `BlockId =
//! layer_idx`, `slot_bytes` = one layer's weight size, and a schedule-driven (not LRU) `touch`
//! order (a dense decode visits layers in a fixed known order, so it can exact-prefetch layer
//! `l+1` while `l` runs) — nothing in the arena/LUT/upload core below assumes MoE or LRU.
//!
//! # LUT
//! The host keeps an `n_blocks`-entry mirror of per-block resident SLOT INDICES
//! (`infr_core::pager::NOT_RESIDENT` for an absent block). The paged EXECUTION path never reads a
//! live device LUT: each (layer, role) batch freezes its `n_expert`-entry window into the
//! session's append-only LUT tape ([`MoePagerSession::lut_window`]) at record time, so staging
//! for later layers can keep mutating the mirror while earlier recorded-but-in-flight segments
//! read a consistent view. The classic per-pager device LUT + [`GpuPager::flush_lut`] remain for
//! the standalone [`GpuPager::ensure_resident`] surface (parity tests / future non-MoE users).
//!
//! # Eviction policy
//! Classic LRU for recency-driven touches (decode's routed-only path) plus the scan-resistant
//! cold-end insertion (`infr_core::pager::Pager::touch_cold`) for the batched prefill's
//! full-set sweeps — see that method's doc for why plain LRU is pathological there. llama.cpp
//! issue #20757's SLRU-with-admission remains the documented upgrade if these thrash on an
//! adversarial pattern.

//   - MIXED-dtype roles: unsloth-dynamic (UD) quants bump a SUBSET of layers' banks to a wider
//     format for quality (gemma-4-MoE: down = Q5_1 on 29 layers + Q8_0 on 1; DiffusionGemma:
//     down = Q5_0/Q8_0 16/14; Qwen3.6-UD: down mixes Q4_K/Q6_K). Slot sizes differ per dtype, so
//     one arena can't hold both — but a pool PER byte-size can: each layer registers into the
//     pool matching its own per-expert byte size, and a dispatch only ever reads ids of ONE
//     layer (whose dtype it knows statically from the graph), so blocks of different dtypes that
//     happen to share a byte size may even share a pool safely.
//   - FUSED gate_up banks (gemma-4 MoE / DiffusionGemma `ffn_gate_up_exps`): a fused expert is
//     just a BIGGER uniform block ([ne, 2*n_ff_exp] instead of [ne, n_ff_exp]) — it pages under
//     `Role::Gate` with its own slot size, and the model simply has no `Role::Up` pool.
// Every pool shares the same GLOBAL block-id space (`layer_index * n_expert + local_id`), so the
// paged kernels' `lut[layer_base + expert]` hop is unchanged — a pool's LUT just holds
// NOT_RESIDENT for the layers that live in other pools (they are never asked for).
//
// Design note (see the task doc): `Op::MoeFfn` carries NO `paged` flag. A paged layer's graph is
// byte-for-byte the same shape as a resident one (same tensor roles, same op) — only the ACTUAL
// buffer bound at `gate_exps`/`up_exps`/`down_exps` differs (a tiny placeholder vs the full
// upload). Threading a per-layer paging flag through `generate_dense_backend` (~20 parameters, 16
// call sites shared by CPU/Vulkan/Metal) to recompute at every graph-build call is a much bigger,
// riskier diff than keying off the buffer ACTUALLY bound at execute time — which the adapter
// already has in hand via `Bindings`. So the placement decision lives entirely on this side: the
// seam registers each paged layer's source bytes once at weight-load time, keyed by the stable
// identity of the (tiny, otherwise-unread) placeholder buffer it bound in place of a real upload;
// `execute_static` looks up that identity when it meets a `MoeFfn` op, and only diverts to the
// segmented paged path on a hit. CPU and Metal never call any of this — zero changes there.

// ─── Dense layer-streaming session ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The MoE session above is demand-driven (routing is GPU-decided, residency resolves per touch);
// dense streaming is the SCHEDULE-driven policy `infr_core::pager`'s module doc names: a dense
// forward visits layers in one fixed order every pass, so the host knows every "miss" in advance
// and needs NO readbacks, NO LUT hop and NO paged kernel twins at all. One block = one per-layer
// weight tensor GROUP exactly as the seam uploads it (a fused qkv or gate_up concat is one
// block; split tensors are one block each) — every dense kernel already reads its weight from a
// `w_off` ELEMENT offset (the stacked-MoE-tensor convention), so a streamed dispatch computes the
// resident slot's base BYTE address (`arena_addr + slot * slot_bytes`, 64-bit — see
// `GpuPager::arena_addr`/`DensePagerSession::stage`) and rides the op's own `w_off` on top as a
// within-slot element offset, exactly like the resident path's binding + offset.
// Pools are keyed per (dtype, padded byte stride) tensor class — same reasoning as the MoE
// per-(role, slot_bytes) pools (fixed slot offsets require uniform strides; mixed-precision GGUFs
// bump a subset of layers' tensors to a wider format).
//
// Rejected alternatives (design notes for the seam this replaces):
//   - Descriptor-level (buffer, offset) rebinding: `Recorder::bind_descriptors` binds
//     `(buffer, 0, WHOLE_SIZE)` through ~seventy dispatch helpers — threading a per-binding
//     offset through every signature is a much bigger, riskier diff than reusing the `w_off`
//     element offset the kernels already take, and buys nothing (same descriptor write count).
//   - `-DPAGED` LUT twins of the dense kernels (the MoE route): pointless indirection — the host
//     knows the slot at record time, so the offset can be baked directly; a LUT hop would add a
//     device dependency for information the host already has.
//   - Embeddings / lm_head / norms / biases stay RESIDENT: norms and biases are consumed by ops
//     with no weight-offset support and are tiny (a few KB/layer); token_embd/lm_head are read at
//     every token edge — streaming lm_head would add its full bytes to every token's PCIe bill
//     with zero locality to exploit, a strict loss.

/// Where one streamed dense block's bytes live: one or more consecutive zero-copy views into the
