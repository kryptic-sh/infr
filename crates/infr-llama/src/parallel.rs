//! [`ParallelSeam`] — the N-slot concurrent generation engine behind `infr serve --parallel N`.
//!
//! # What this is (and what it is not)
//!
//! It is **interleaved concurrent generation**: N sequences are in flight at once, each on its own
//! thread with its own KV slot, and they take turns on the GPU at TOKEN granularity via a fair
//! round-robin baton ([`crate::sampling::StepGate`]). A request is never head-of-line blocked
//! behind another request's whole generation — only behind one step of it.
//!
//! It is **not** continuous batching. llama.cpp gathers the N active sequences' next tokens into
//! ONE forward at `m = n_active`, which amortises the weight traffic across them and makes
//! aggregate throughput RISE with concurrency. We cannot express that today: [`infr_core::Op`]'s
//! `Attention` binds exactly one `k_cache`/`v_cache`, one `kv_len` and one `pos` for all its query
//! rows, so N rows cannot attend to N different KV caches in one dispatch. Getting there needs a
//! per-row `(cache, kv_len, pos)` indirection (a block table) plumbed through ~8 recorder attention
//! entry points and ~12 Vulkan shaders, plus the CPU/Metal backends, plus inverting this crate's
//! monolithic `generate_dense_backend` into a per-step API. That is a real project, and it is the
//! ONLY thing standing between this engine and the mrow-kernel throughput win.
//!
//! So: aggregate throughput here is roughly FLAT in N (each sequence still re-streams the whole
//! weight matrix for its own decode step). What N buys is *fairness and latency* — 4 agent tool
//! calls finish in ~the time of the slowest, not the sum. That is the difference between usable and
//! unusable for a fan-out coding agent, and it is an honest fraction of the win.
//!
//! # VRAM: how `-np` interacts with `--ctx`
//!
//! N slots means N KV caches. The per-slot context is therefore `min(n_ctx_train, kv_fit_ctx / N)`
//! by default, so the N slots TOGETHER are bounded by exactly the VRAM fit that bounds one slot:
//! raising `-np` can never OOM a device that `-np 1` fit. (It is NOT the same footprint — when the
//! trained window is below the fit, `-np 4` does allocate more total KV than `-np 1`; what it
//! cannot do is exceed the budget. The visible cost is the per-request window shrinking.) An
//! explicit `--ctx C` is used verbatim per slot, and the Vulkan alloc-time budget guard is left to
//! fail it cleanly if `N * C` truly doesn't fit.
//!
//! Slots are forked EAGERLY at startup (weights are shared through `Arc<SeamWeights>`; a fork costs
//! only its own KV + IO buffers). That means a VRAM refusal happens at boot with a clear message,
//! never halfway through serving.
