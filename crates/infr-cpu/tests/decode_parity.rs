//! Per-dtype block-decode parity for the CPU interpreter, on the shared `infr-testkit` harness.
//!
//! This is the harness's **GPU-less** instantiation: it needs no device, so it runs in a plain
//! `cargo test` and is the thing that proves the harness itself (synth → oracle → seam → score)
//! before any GPU test relies on it.
//!
//! Why it is not redundant with the oracle it compares against: `infr-cpu`'s quant `Linear` does
//! NOT call `dequant_block`. It quantizes the activation row to int8 and runs a per-format
//! `vec_dot_*` kernel (`infr_cpu::kernels`) that decodes the weight bytes itself — an INDEPENDENT
//! decoder from `infr_gguf::dequant`. So this sweep is a genuine two-implementation cross-check of
//! all 24 weight formats, not a tautology.
//!
//! Run: `cargo test -p infr-cpu --test decode_parity -- --nocapture`
