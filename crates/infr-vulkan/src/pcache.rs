//! On-disk `vkPipelineCache` persistence — the Vulkan-specific SHELL around
//! [`infr_core::kernel_cache::KernelCache`].
//!
//! Pipeline creation (`vkCreateComputePipelines`) is the driver's GPU-specific codegen and was
//! measured at ~5s across a cold DG forward's kernel set — all one-time work that previously
//! re-ran every process launch (we passed `vk::PipelineCache::null()` everywhere and relied
//! incidentally on Mesa's own shader cache, which softens but does not eliminate it). This module
//! seeds ONE `vk::PipelineCache` from a per-device file at backend init and writes it back
//! (debounced, and finally on drop), so every launch after the first creates pipelines from cached
//! binaries.
//!
//! **Everything that is not Vulkan lives in `infr-core`'s [`KernelCache`]** — the envelope, the
//! payload checksum, the atomic+durable write, and THE TRIPWIRE that caught a hung shader binary
//! sitting in this very file (read that module's doc; it is the design rationale). What stays
//! here is what only Vulkan knows:
//!
//! - **The KEY** (compared verbatim by `KernelCache`): `driverVersion ++ pipelineCacheUUID ++
//!   SHADER_SET_FINGERPRINT`.
//!   - The DRIVER validates its own header inside the blob (vendor/device/driverVersion/cacheUUID)
//!     and silently ignores data it can't use — so a driver upgrade never corrupts, at worst it
//!     recompiles once. We fold `driverVersion` in anyway because a version flip also means
//!     retired entries would sit in the file forever; treat it like a shader-set change and start
//!     fresh.
//!   - `pipelineCacheUUID` is the driver's OWN identity for "binaries I can consume". The file is
//!     already keyed per (vendor_id, device_id) by NAME, and the driver re-checks this UUID in the
//!     header it embeds inside the payload. Carrying it in OUR key too closes the one gap those
//!     leave: a driver REBUILD (or a distro rebuild) can keep `driverVersion` while changing the
//!     cache UUID, and the reward for guessing wrong is a driver handed binaries it considers
//!     valid-ish — undefined behavior, i.e. a hung ring, not an error. Cheap to check, so check it.
//!   - `SHADER_SET_FINGERPRINT` (FNV-1a over every compiled SPIR-V blob — see build.rs): any
//!     shader change discards the old file WHOLESALE instead of letting entries for retired
//!     pipeline variants accumulate in the blob forever.
//! - **The API calls**: `vkGetPipelineCacheData` to produce the payload, `vkCreatePipelineCache`
//!   to consume it (in `lib.rs`), and the device-lost verdict on drop.
//! - **The DEBOUNCED mid-run saves.** Unique to Vulkan: the driver's cache GROWS during a run as
//!   new pipelines are created, so the file must be rewritten periodically for a long-lived
//!   process that never drops cleanly (a `serve` under SIGKILL). Metal's binary archive, by
//!   contrast, is produced once, whole, at init — it has nothing to re-save.
//!
//! `kernels.vulkan.pipeline_cache_disk = false` disables persistence (the in-process cache handle
//! still works).
