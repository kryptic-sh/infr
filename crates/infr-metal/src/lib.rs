#![cfg(target_os = "macos")]
//! Reference Metal compute backend — a correctness-first implementation of the [`Backend`] seam
//! (the same one `infr-cpu` and `infr-vulkan` implement) on Apple's Metal API.
//!
//! Priorities are *correctness and clarity* first, then not being needlessly slow. Each op's
//! arithmetic runs in a small Metal compute kernel over f32 `MTLBuffer`s, following `infr-cpu`'s
//! dataflow closely so it stays in numeric parity (see `tests/parity.rs`).
//!
//! To avoid a CPU↔GPU round-trip per op, graph tensors stay *resident on the device*: a per-forward
//! executor (`exec::Resident`) tracks whether each tensor's current value is on the host or the
//! device, encodes consecutive GPU ops into a single command buffer (Metal hazard-tracks the
//! barriers), and only syncs to the host at a host-side op or the final write-back. Quantized
//! `Op::Linear` weights are kept in the compact factored form (`dequant_factored`: bit-packed
//! 4/6/8-bit codes + one i16 `(sc, m)` per 16 elems + one f16 `(d, dmin)` per quant block) and
//! decoded inline by the `linear_quik*` kernels, so the kernels stay format-agnostic and never blow
//! a quant weight up to f32. `INFR_PROF_OPS=1` prints a per-op / GPU-wall breakdown on drop;
//! `=2` isolates per-op GPU wall by flushing after each op (distorts totals); `=3` samples
//! stage-boundary GPU timestamps per op inside ONE command buffer — true in-context per-op GPU
//! time (the decode tape is disabled so every token's ops are walked and attributed).
//!
//! Not bit-for-bit identical to the CPU everywhere: quantized `Op::Linear` reconstructs the exact
//! `dequant` value but dots in f32, whereas the CPU path quantizes the *activation* to Q8 and uses
//! integer dots — so this backend is actually the slightly more accurate of the two. Faster matvec
//! kernels (GEMV occupancy / fusion) are future work.
