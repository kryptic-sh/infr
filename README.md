[![CI](https://github.com/kryptic-sh/infr/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kryptic-sh/infr/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Pure-Rust LLM inference engine. Vulkan-first, built to run on any mainstream
GPU.

> Early WIP. The only non-Rust parts are the GPU driver calls (Vulkan via `ash`)
> and the compute shaders (SPIR-V).

## Goal

A from-the-metal inference server that works across AMD / NVIDIA / Intel
(Vulkan) and Apple (MoltenVK), with native backends addable later behind a
`Compute` trait.

## Status

Runs **Llama / Qwen2 / Qwen3** (dense), **Gemma 3** (dense, sliding-window
attention + QK-norm + GeGLU), and **Gemma 4** (per-layer heterogeneous head
dims, proportional RoPE, V-norm, per-layer output scale — including the **E2B**
variant: per-layer input embeddings, per-layer FFN widths, KV-layer sharing) on
the Vulkan backend, competitive with llama.cpp at long context (`infr compare`).
**Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6** (`qwen35` — hybrid gated-DeltaNet + attention, a sibling
of Qwen3-Next) run on the same unified runner, CPU + Vulkan (`docs/QWEN35.md`).
**DiffusionGemma** (the original target — block text-diffusion MoE on a Gemma-4
backbone, entropy-bound denoise decode) runs end-to-end on CPU + Vulkan
(`docs/DIFFUSIONGEMMA.md`).

```bash
infr pull   <model-ref>        # org/repo[:quant] (HuggingFace) | path to a .gguf
infr run    <model-ref> [msg]  # terminal chat (auto-pulls)
infr serve  <model-ref>        # OpenAI-compatible HTTP API
infr bench / infr compare      # tok/s benchmarks vs llama.cpp
```

Model refs match llama.cpp's `-hf`: `org/repo[:quant]` (quant default `Q4_K_M`,
e.g. `infr run unsloth/Qwen3-14B-GGUF:Q4_K_M`). Models share the standard
**HuggingFace Hub cache** (`~/.cache/huggingface/hub`) with llama.cpp and
`huggingface_hub` — one download, used by both.

## Supported models

All run on the Vulkan GPU backend unless noted. The chat template (turn markers,
system prompt) is read from the GGUF's own `tokenizer.chat_template`.

Fine-tunes on any of these backbones run unchanged. **Ornith-1.0**
(DeepReinforce.AI agentic-coding) validated 2026-07-09 — the 9B rides `qwen35`
and the 35B rides `qwen35moe` with no code changes
(`infr run deepreinforce-ai/Ornith-1.0-9B-GGUF:Q4_K_M "..."`).
**Ternary-Bonsai** (Prism ML, weights trained to {-1, 0, +1}) validated
2026-07-12 — the 1.7B / 4B / 8B all ride `qwen3`, zero-code, both in the TQ2_0
repack (`superkaiii/Ternary-Bonsai-4B-GGUF`) and in llama.cpp's new **Q2_0**
weight dtype (2.25 bpw, GGML type 42 — native in-shader dequant + dp4a mmq, no
fork needed). infr is the **only engine that runs Q2_0 on a GPU** (llama.cpp
merged the dtype CPU-only) — see the perf table below. Pull the `Q2_0_g64`
files: `infr run prism-ml/Ternary-Bonsai-8B-gguf:Q2_0_g64 "..."`.

```bash
# Qwen3 dense
infr run unsloth/Qwen3-1.7B-GGUF:Q4_K_M "What is the capital of France?"

# Qwen3 MoE (experts page through the VRAM LRU cache when they don't fit —

infr run unsloth/Qwen3.5-4B-MTP-GGUF:Q4_K_XL "Explain how a hash map works."

# Sampling: greedy by default (INFR_TEMP=0). Temperature / top-k / top-p:

```

### Serving

```bash
# OpenAI-compatible HTTP API (streaming). Reuses a persistent KV cache across
# requests (common-prefix diff) for fast TTFT on shared-prefix chats.
infr serve unsloth/Qwen3-14B-GGUF:Q4_K_M          # default: 127.0.0.1:8080

curl -s localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions -d '{
  "model": "qwen3",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}],
  "stream": true
}'
```

Works as a drop-in backend for OpenAI-API clients (opencode, the Claude Code
CLI, etc.). Tool calling renders the model's own `tokenizer.chat_template`
(Qwen, Llama-3.x, Gemma tool dialects supported).

Sampling is greedy at `INFR_TEMP=0`; otherwise `INFR_TEMP` / `INFR_TOP_K` /
`INFR_TOP_P` control it (see
[Benchmarking & profiling](#benchmarking--profiling) for the full env list).

## Benchmarking & profiling

`infr bench` matches `llama-bench`'s `-p`/`-n`/`-d`/`-r` flags, so the two are
directly comparable. Pipelines are compiled and GPU state is first-touched at
model load (`Llama::warmup`), so timing measures compute, not one-time setup.
**Run benchmarks one at a time** — concurrent GPU work skews results.

```bash
M='unsloth/Qwen3-30B-A3B-GGUF:Q4_K_M'   # MoE perf target

# Prefill (pp = n_prompt/time) and decode (tg = n_gen/time):
infr bench "$M" -p 2048 -n 0 -r 3       # prefill 2048 tokens
infr bench "$M" -p 8000 -n 0 -r 2       # prefill at depth
infr bench "$M" -p 0 -n 64 -r 3         # decode 64 tokens
infr bench "$M" -p 0 -n 64 -d 2048      # decode at context depth 2048 (-d warms, untimed)
```

**Profile** per-op GPU time (timestamp queries) with `INFR_PROF2=1`. Every
dispatch is timestamped and labeled **automatically with its kernel name** (plus
a few role overrides like `expert_gateup`/`expert_down`); no manual stamping. It
prints one block per submit and ONE aggregated `INFR_PROF2 GPU report` at
process exit (per-kernel totals, counts, avg, %GPU over all timed submits —
warmup runs unprofiled). Add `INFR_PROF2_SHAPES=1` for shape-itemized GEMV/GEMM
buckets (`mmvr:m4:1536x24576`). Decode's replay tape carries no timestamps —
profile decode with `INFR_SEAM_NO_REPLAY=1`. Details in
[`docs/PERF.md`](docs/PERF.md).

```bash
INFR_PROF2=1 infr bench "$M" -p 2048 -n 0 -r 1 2>&1 | tail -30   # exit aggregate
```

**Validate Vulkan work** — any change touching `infr-vulkan` (kernels, recorder,
adapter, pager) must run its GPU tests and at least one end-to-end generation
under the Khronos validation layer, and fix every error AND warning it reports
before landing (validation silence is the bar, not "it produces the right
tokens" — robust-access reads, missing barriers, and binding-range overflows can
return plausible garbage instead of crashing):

```bash
VK_LOADER_LAYERS_ENABLE=VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation cargo test -p infr-vulkan -- --ignored
VK_LOADER_LAYERS_ENABLE=VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation infr run "$M" "smoke prompt"
```

The layer ships with the `vulkan-validation-layers` package. It slows GPU work
noticeably — use it for correctness passes, never inside timed benches.

**Compare to llama.cpp** — `infr compare` shells out to `infr bench` and the
system `llama-bench` with matching flags on coding-agent-shaped workloads
(prefill, decode-at-depth, whole turns). `--ctx` is comma-delimited:

```bash
infr compare "$M" --ctx 8000,16000 --gen 256 --turn 2048,256 --reps 2
```

**DiffusionGemma** has no upstream-merged `llama-bench` support, so
`infr compare`/`infr compare --sweep` route `arch=diffusion-gemma` models to a
different oracle: the reference fork's `llama-diffusion-cli`
(`~/Projects/mxaddict/llama.cpp-dg`, resolved via `INFR_LLAMA_DIFFUSION_CLI` >
`PATH` > the fork's `build-vulkan`/`build` directories — see
`ModelBench::llama_diffusion_cli_path` for the exact precedence and its PATH
fallback caveat). It prints two rows instead of the usual pp/tg matrix:
`dg-step` (in-step-parallel tok/s ratio — the apples-to-apples number, since
both implementations run entropy-bound and take a different number of denoise
steps) and `dg-e2e` (informational end-to-end tok/s, each side's own step count
folded into the row so the mismatch is visible). Details in
[`docs/DIFFUSIONGEMMA.md`](docs/DIFFUSIONGEMMA.md).

Useful env: `INFR_TEMP` / `INFR_TOP_K` / `INFR_TOP_P` (sampling; `TEMP=0` →
greedy), `INFR_MAX_NEW`, `INFR_CTX`, `INFR_NO_FLASH`.

**MoE expert placement**: resident when the expert banks fit VRAM (zero config,
zero change); otherwise every layer pages through a VRAM-resident LRU expert
cache (`infr_vulkan::pager`) sized to the remaining VRAM. `INFR_CACHE=<size>`
forces every layer through the pager with that budget regardless of fit (useful
for testing, or to free VRAM for a larger context). Every bank shape pages:
split gate/up (llama4/Qwen3-MoE/Qwen3.6-MoE), fused gate_up (DiffusionGemma,
Gemma-4 MoE — one double-width slot per expert), and mixed-dtype roles
(unsloth-dynamic quants bumping a subset of layers' banks to a wider K-quant —
one arena pool per (role, byte size)). `INFR_PAGER_STATS=1` prints each pool's
hit/miss/eviction counts.

**Dense layer streaming**: DENSE models bigger than VRAM stream their per-layer
projection weights (attn q/k/v/o + FFN gate/up/down, as the same fused
qkv/gate_up groups the loader uploads) through the same paged VRAM machinery —
but schedule-driven, not LRU: a dense forward visits layers in one fixed order,
so residency uses an exact cyclic-sweep policy (Belady-parity — a stable
resident prefix plus one churn slot per pool) and there are NO readbacks
anywhere (every "miss" is known in advance; misses ride recorded ring→arena
copies on the same pipelined fenced-half staging ring the MoE path uses, so CPU
memcpys for later layers overlap GPU execution of earlier ones). Streamed
dispatches are the ordinary dense kernels reading the pool arena at a slot
element offset (the `w_off` convention) — no kernel variants, so streamed output
is token-identical to the resident run. Embeddings, lm_head, norms and biases
stay resident (lm_head is read at every token edge — streaming it adds its full
bytes to every token's PCIe bill with zero locality to exploit). Placement is
automatic (resident when everything fits — zero change); `INFR_CACHE=<size>`
forces streaming with that budget. Honest expectations: prefill amortizes
uploads across the whole batch (Qwen3-14B Q8_0, ~15.7 GB, at `INFR_CACHE=8g`:
pp512 987 t/s vs 1505 resident = 0.66×); decode has no locality to exploit, so
it is capped at PCIe_bw ÷ overflow_bytes per token — physics, not a bug (same
setup: ~7.0 GB re-uploaded per token ÷ ~22 GB/s ≈ 3.1 t/s ceiling, measured 3.1
t/s; the CPU backend does 4.4 t/s at that ~45% overflow, so streaming only beats
CPU when the overflow is smaller — measured crossover on this box is around a
quarter of the model overflowing). An MoE model whose DENSE part also doesn't
fit is out of scope and errors clearly.

**Size grammar** — `INFR_CACHE` and `INFR_CTX` share one value grammar
(`infr_core::parse_size`): a plain number is the base unit (bytes for
`INFR_CACHE`, tokens for `INFR_CTX`), `k`/`m`/`g`/`t` suffixes scale by 1024
(`INFR_CACHE=19g`, `INFR_CTX=256k`), and `%` resolves against the
device-appropriate base — available VRAM for the expert cache, the free-VRAM KV
capacity for the Vulkan context (`INFR_CACHE=80%`, `INFR_CTX=50%`; on the
CPU/Metal chat paths a ctx-`%` resolves against the model's trained context).

**Resident-BDA weight arena** — always on; it is the only weight path. Routes
every weight allocation into one `bufferDeviceAddress` arena and has the kernels
read their weights by 64-bit device address instead of through per-tensor SSBO
descriptor bindings — dense projection weights and MoE expert banks read via
`-DSTREAMED` kernel twins, sub-tensors via sub-range descriptor binds, and the
paged expert cache composes on top unchanged. The addressing is bitwise-identical
to the retired u32-SSBO descriptor path across the whole model zoo (dense, MoE,
qwen35/DeltaNet, DiffusionGemma, and the paged Scout experts — proven by the
`gpu_seam` goldens and the streamed-parity suites), and runs at-or-faster than
that path on RDNA3 (7900 XTX) on the dense and qwen3-MoE paths.

## Validated models & performance

Everything below is **validated on an AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX** (RDNA3, 24 GB,
Vulkan / RADV): correctness is checked against the CPU reference implementation
(the `gpu_seam_matches_cpu_*` tests generate token-for-token on both and
compare) and throughput is measured against the system `llama.cpp` build with
`infr compare`.

**Throughput vs llama.cpp** — ratios are `infr / llama.cpp` (**>1.0 = infr is
faster**); r=3, 2026-07-13 snapshot (commit `2b3a943`, every model×quant in the
local cache, oracle `llama-bench` **b9957** on every row). Hardware: **AMD
Radeon RX 7900 XTX** (RDNA3, 24 GB, Vulkan / RADV, Mesa). `pp512` = 512-token
prefill throughput, `tg128` = 128-token decode throughput, `tg64@d4096` = decode
at 4096 KV depth, `pp4@d4096` = short-turn prefill at 4096 KV depth (the
multi-turn serve shape). **`pp512` is run-to-run noisy (±5%)** — infr's default
prefill is nondeterministic in its tier/chunk choice (a known open issue), so
treat small `pp512` deltas as noise, not signal.

**Both prefill columns are clean.** `pp4@d4096` (the multi-turn serve shape) wins
on **every row**, 1.05× to 2.16×. `pp512` wins on every row but one — Gemma-4-31B
at 0.98×, inside the ±5% noise band. Prefill used to carry losses on the MoE
rows, the DeltaNet rows and the grid i-quants; the four kernel slices below
(footnotes ⁵, ⁶, ⁸, ⁹) closed all of them.

**Decode is now a win or a tie on 30 of 35 rows.** The five that remain are named
in "Where infr loses". The big lever was NOT a GEMV kernel: `rmsnorm` was
dispatching a **single workgroup** at decode (footnote ⁸), which cost ~9% of all
decode GPU time on every model with hidden ≥ 2048. Fixing that one kernel turned
the whole mid/large decode band (8B–27B) from losses into wins.

¹ **Q6_K now decodes on the int8 tier too** (`f82d74e` + `de987d7`). It was the
last format still unpacking its `ql`/`qh` bit-planes **byte-at-a-time** (8 scalar
`rb()` loads per 32-element sub-block, where every other k-quant already read
aligned u32s and masked in-register) — and it was the only format badly LOSING at
decode (Qwen3-14B-Q6_K: 44.3 int8 vs 58.9 f32 t/s, **−25%**). Those two facts
were the same fact. A word-parallel `wdec` rewrite (funnel-shifted `ru32u` word
loads — Q6_K's 210-byte stride is 2 mod 4, so it needs the stitch — plus a SWAR
`q−32` rebias) is **bit-identical** to the old byte loop and inverted the result:
decode 44.3 → **64.3 t/s**, now BEATING f32's 58.4; prefill `pp4@d4096` 137.9 →
**183.6** (+34%). Unpack ALU, not memory bandwidth, was the wall.

² **MTP speculative decode is currently DISABLED — see "MTP is parked" below.**
These rows are the models' ORDINARY (non-speculative) numbers, which is how the
MTP-head GGUFs now run. `INFR_MTP=1` is ignored with a warning; the `mtp128`
column is no longer measured.

These four rows' `tg64@d4096` cells were a GPU device-lost in the raw sweep and
are re-measured post-`8513358`: 35821b6's capacity gate on the `nonfa` coopmat
prefill tier (which reads K in whole 256-row tiles, so it touches
`ceil(kv_len/256)*256` rows) had no catcher for a **non-SWA** model — `split_ok`
only covered the SWA `ring_past` case — so the op fell through to the scalar
`attention_kv` at 3591 rows × 3591 kv and hung the GPU. MTP's un-chunked
whole-prompt verify is the only shape that reliably lands `kv_len` within one
tile-pad of the cache's row capacity.

³ **The int8-activation decode tier.** Quantizing the *activations* to int8 and
integer-dotting them against the raw weight codes (`dotPacked4x8AccSatEXT`, the
`mmvq` shape) avoids dequantizing weights to f32 at all. On AMD the tier is now
default-on for **Q2_K, Q4_K, Q6_K, Q4_0, Q5_0, Q5_1, IQ4_NL**; **ordinary prefill
takes it for every integer dtype** (all 12). This row (Qwen3-14B Q2_K) is what it
bought at 2 bits: tg128 0.74× → 0.81×, tg64@d4096 0.72× → 0.78×, and `pp4@d4096`
0.98× → a win. (The table's current values for this row, 0.85×/0.81×/1.49×, also
include the later wide-rmsnorm lift — footnote ⁸.)

The single most useful thing learned here: **int8's value is row-count
dependent, and the two directions are independent policies.** The cost of the
tier is a per-dispatch activation-quantize pass; the benefit is the unpack ALU it
saves. At m=1 (decode) the quantize is dead weight amortized over one row, so a
dtype with a cheap unpack (Q8_0 — at 8 bits the stored byte already IS the dp4a
operand) *loses*. At m≥3 (prefill) it amortizes hard and every integer dtype
wins, by +21% to +67%. So a dtype can lose decode and win prefill by a mile, and
infr ships two separate policy sets to say so — `mmv_int8_decode_dtypes` (m=1)
and `mrow_int8_prefill_dtypes` (m≥3), in `crates/infr-vulkan/src/adapter.rs`.
Conflating them is what used to keep Q3_K/Q5_K/Q6_K's large prefill wins
unreachable: they were tied to an off-by-default decode tier.

Every entry is **measured on infr's own kernels**, not inherited from
llama.cpp's table — the two engines have different kernel overheads, so a win on
one does not imply a win on the other. (llama.cpp's `ggml_vk_should_use_mmvq`
returns true for every quant on AMD at `k >= 2048`, carving out only Q6_K and
Q8_0, so taking this trade is parity with the oracle, not a quality regression.)

**Q3_K stays OFF at decode** — and this is an accuracy result, not a perf one.
Flipping it broke `gpu_seam_matches_cpu_qwen3_q2k` into **degenerate** output
(`<think>` repeated to the token limit against the oracle's coherent answer).
Cause: **GGUFs are mixed** — unsloth's Qwen3-0.6B-**Q2_K** file carries Q3_K
tensors — so a "Q3_K" flip silently moved a 0.6B model's layers to int8, where
accumulated quantization error is worst, and it fell off a coherence cliff. The
cliff was then isolated to the *decode* side specifically: the same test run
PREFILL-int8-only stays coherent and matches the CPU oracle token-for-token,
while DECODE-int8-only reproduces the divergence exactly. So Q3_K's prefill win
ships and its decode tier does not. **Q5_K** is off at decode on a plain
throughput call (−1.4% decode, +45% prefill); its accuracy was never in
question. Re-attempting Q3_K decode needs the accuracy question answered
(per-tensor-role gating? a size floor?), not a re-measure.


⁴ Gemma-4-31B (21.9 GiB weights on the 24 GB card) runs **fully resident,
including at depth**, after two placement slices: try-resident-first dense
placement (`e2c0694` — honest activation reserve + a phantom +1.6 GiB accounting
fix) and **window-sized ring KV for sliding-window layers** (`35821b6`,
llama.cpp-parity: 50 of its 60 layers are SWA with a 1024 window, so their
caches are 2048-row rings instead of full-context — @8k that's 0.44 GiB instead
of 5.5). The d4096 row went 0.08× → 0.90× (28 vs 31 t/s). The same slice also
reuses empty KV slots instead of forking a duplicate (`f74556c` — was silently
wasting a full KV per session, 6.25 GiB on a 14B), and lifted the gemma-family
multi-turn rows (12B `pp4@d4096` 1.40× → 1.66×: less dead KV to re-scan).

This row's `pp4@d4096` was the table's worst loss at 0.84×; it is now **1.32×**,
a win. That came from Q5_K's ordinary-prefill int8 tier (footnote ³) — this is a
Q5_K_XL file, and Q5_K's prefill win (+45%) was previously unreachable because it
was gated behind an off-by-default *decode* tier. Splitting the two policies
banked it. Its **decode** was then closed too (0.91×/0.92× → **0.98×/1.00×**) by
the wide rmsnorm (footnote ⁸) — this model, at 21.9 GiB on a 24 GB card and 57% of
its GPU time in one Q5_K GEMV, is where that kernel was found. The fix added zero
allocations, so it still loads fully resident (peak 23.14 / 23.98 GiB).

⁵ **The DeltaNet scan: chunking was the bug, not the fix** (`0a5d366`). Ornith-35B
`pp512` was 0.89× — its scan ran **31.7 ms per 512 tokens against llama.cpp's
6.8 ms**, 4.6× slower, and that one kernel was the whole loss. Reading llama.cpp's
`gated_delta_net.comp` showed its "fused" GDN is **not chunked at all**: it is the
plain token-serial recurrence with the state shard held in **registers**.

Counting FLOPs kills the chunked premise outright — the chunked delta rule costs
~420M FMA/layer against ~402M for the plain recurrence, so it **saves no
arithmetic**. It only shortens the dependency chain, and it pays for that with
LDS-resident state, runtime trip counts that block unrolling, ~96 workgroup
barriers, and only 256 workgroups (~2.7 per CU on a 96-CU part — nothing in
flight to hide latency). It sustained **0.76 TFLOP/s against llama.cpp's 3.5**.

The fix was to go *simpler*, not more fused: single-subgroup workgroups (zero
barriers; the kd-contractions become one `subgroupAdd`), state in registers, and
all transcendentals hoisted out of the serial loop into a flat gates pass.
**31.7 → 8.4 ms.** `pp512` 0.89× → **1.03×**, and every one of Ornith-35B's four
metrics is now a win. It also lifted the other DeltaNet models (Ornith-9B, the
Qwen3.5/3.6 family). Decode is untouched (`rows == 1` still routes to the old
sequential kernel). Gated on `kd == 128`; `INFR_DN_CHUNK_SCAN=1` restores the old
path. The path no longer needs coopmat at all, so non-coopmat GPUs get the fast
kernel too. Nulls: LDS-staging the k̂/q̂ tiles **regressed** it to 51.4 ms
(occupancy collapse), and the bandwidth theory was simply wrong — cutting traffic
4× bought 6%, so it was latency-bound all along.

⁶ Grid i-quant (IQ1–IQ3) row: the grid-perf slice closed both structural gaps
`618cd3b` left behind (that commit fixed the device-lost TDR — dynamically
indexed GLSL `const` codebook tables lowered to ~1 MB of per-invocation scratch
by RADV/ACO — by staging the grids through `shared` memory): a grid-aware
`dqblk` amortizes the per-32-group scale/sign/qh decode and grid gathers that
the per-element `dq()` re-derived (decode 0.50× → 0.89×, tg128 75 → 134 t/s),
and IQ2_S/IQ3_S — this file's expert pair — got batched dp4a mmq expert GEMMs
(shared-LUT grid staging feeds the int8 dot; prefill 0.03× → 0.91×, pp512 75 →
2575 t/s). The other five grid formats keep the id-GEMV prefill fallback (no
shipped MoE GGUF uses them for expert banks — see `MOE_MMQ_DTYPES`'s exclusions
doc).

**Prefill is now a WIN** (`c7c3f50`): `pp512` 0.90× → **1.16×**. The gap was
codebook *staging*, not bandwidth — the discriminator is that this file's Q4_K_M
sibling (same architecture, arithmetic experts) runs `expert_gateup` in 46 ms
while moving **1.76× more weight bytes**. Two causes, in places nobody had looked:
IQ2_S's scale nibble covers 16 elements, so its mmq k-loop ran at `BLK=16` — the
*only* expert kernel doing k/16 passes where Q4_K/Q6_K/IQ3_S/IQ4_XS all do k/32,
i.e. double the barriers, scale staging and activation loads for identical dp4a
work. Merging it to `BLK=32` is bit-identical (the two halves provably share one
sub-block index and one scale byte at a 32-aligned start, and the partial sums
fold in the old loop's exact summation order — proved against a host dequant
reference by `grid_mmq_parity`) and took `expert_gateup` 82.4 → **65.8 ms**. IQ3_S's
down-projection also joined the subgroup id-GEMV band (42 → 34.8 ms).

**Decode is still a loss** (0.93× / 0.94×, up from 0.89× / 0.90×) and the
remaining lever is *quantified but deliberately not taken*: ablating the codebook
staging entirely measures `native_idm_iq2s` 49.8 → **23.3 ms** and
`native_idm_iq3s` 42.0 → **18.9 ms** — i.e. **~50 ms of a 505 ms decode is pure
per-workgroup re-staging of the codebook into LDS**, which is essentially the
whole residual gap. The fix is to make the codebook **L2-resident in a buffer**
instead of re-staged by every workgroup (this also frees 8 KB of LDS per
workgroup, so it should beat the ablation). That needs a new SSBO binding across
every grid GEMV variant and re-validation of all 7 grid dtypes — a campaign of its
own, not a slice. Null: an SG tier for IQ2_S gate/up **regressed** hard
(`native_idm_iq2s` 49.8 → 117.2 ms — 8 KB of LDS on a single-wave workgroup
collapses occupancy).

⁷ **The legacy 32-block quants now have an int8 dp4a GEMV**, not just a dp4a
GEMM. The dp4a *GEMM* (`native_gemm_mmq_*`) has covered ~17 dtypes for a while,
but the dp4a *GEMV* (`native_mmv_mrow.comp`) covered only the six k-quants +
IQ4_XS — so every non-k-quant integer file fell to the f32 dequant path at
decode AND at small-m prefill, which is exactly why this Q8_0 row was one of the
table's three `pp4@d4096` LOSSES. Q8_0/Q4_0/Q5_0/Q4_1/Q5_1/IQ4_NL now have
`wdec` arms (the mmq unpack, word-parallelized: aligned/funnel-shifted u32 loads
— every `_0`-family stride is 2 mod 4 — nibble masks, SWAR zero-point rebias, a
4-bit→4-byte-lane `qh` spread, and Q4_1/Q5_1's additive min folded through the
ones-dot against `sact`). Measured on Qwen3-14B (7900 XTX), int8 vs the f32
GEMV that shipped before, **ordinary prefill** (`pp4@d4096`): Q4_0 **+66.9%**,
Q5_0 **+64.0%**, Q5_1 **+42.2%**, Q4_1 **+32.9%**, Q8_0 **+28.8%** (128 → 158
t/s — this row: 0.92× → **1.18×**), IQ4_NL **+20.7%**. **Decode** (`tg64`) is a
separate policy and splits: Q5_0 **+16.8%**, Q4_0 **+10.5%**, IQ4_NL **+6.3%**,
Q5_1 **+6.1%** are default-ON; **Q8_0 −4.2%, and Q4_1 a wash, are default-OFF**
(prefill-only). Q8_0's decode loss is structural, not a wart to fix — at 8 bits
the stored byte already IS the dp4a operand, so there is no unpack ALU to save,
and decode is weight-bandwidth bound while the int8 route still pays the
`quant_q8` bubble (llama.cpp excludes Q8_0 from mmvq off old GCN for the same
reason). Hence this row's `tg64@d4096` stays 0.97×: the fix is a prefill fix.
Guards: `mmv_mrow_legacy_formats` (each `wdec` vs a from-scratch host reference,
f64-accumulated), `mmv_row1_bit_identical` (m=1 decode ≡ row 0 of the m≥3
dispatch, exact `to_bits()`), and all 13 `gpu_seam_matches_cpu_*` (two of which
load an IQ4_NL and a Q8_0 model, so the decode flips face the CPU oracle).

⁸ **The decode "bandwidth wall" was mostly a norm kernel running on one
workgroup** (`2b3a943`) — the highest-leverage fix in this table, and it is not a
GEMV. `rmsnorm` dispatches one workgroup **per row**, so at decode (`rows == 1`)
the entire dispatch was a *single* 256-thread workgroup — 8 wave32s on **one WGP
out of 48** — reducing a 21 KB row. Pure latency with nothing in flight: **12.7 µs
per dispatch, against ~1.2 µs for `add` over the same vector** (which fans out to
`dim/64` workgroups). At 241 dispatches per token that was **8.9% of all decode
GPU time**. A whole-row reduction cannot be split across workgroups without a
second dispatch, so the fix keeps the single workgroup but restores memory-level
parallelism *inside* it: **1024 threads × vec4 loads** = 4× the waves and 4× the
bytes per request. **12.7 → 4.0 µs.** Gated to `rows == 1 && dim >= 2048`; the
256-thread build's SPIR-V is byte-identical, so the change is purely additive.

This is **not model-specific** — it lifts every model with hidden ≥ 2048, and it
is what turned the entire 8B–27B decode band from losses into wins (Qwen3-8B
`tg128` 0.96× → 1.02×, Qwen3-14B Q4_K_M 0.97× → 1.02×, Gemma-3-12B 1.02× → 1.12×,
Gemma-4-26B MoE 1.01× → 1.13×).

It also corrects a story this README told for a long time. "Decode is
weight-bandwidth bound" was **measured but incomplete**: `native_q8_0` runs the
*same* `native_gemv` kernel at the *same* m=1 shape and reaches **863 GB/s = 90%
of the card's ~960 GB/s peak** — that is the real wall — while Q5_K, at 57% of all
GPU time, sat at **737 GB/s (77%)**. Same kernel, so the memory system was never
the difference. Null result from the same slice: the Q5_K *ALU* hypothesis was
**falsified** — a SWAR rewrite of its 5-bit rebuild predicted ~22% and measured
**2.3%** (ACO was already fusing the shift+mask into `v_bfe_u32`); it shipped
anyway because it is bit-identical and free. The genuine residual is **VMEM
instruction count** (a Q5_K sub-block issues 16 word loads to Q8_0's 8, and a
superblock's `qh` bytes get re-read ~3× by its sub-blocks), which needs
superblock-granular decode — left open. **BF16 decode** (0.87×) is the one row
none of this can help: it is the only non-integer weight dtype, so there is no
unpack ALU to save and no weight codes to integer-dot.

⁹ **MoE expert GEMMs: the waste was inside the tile, not in the routing**
(`6a33065`). The expert GEMMs are **72% of MoE prefill GPU time**. The suspicion
was that infr lacked llama.cpp's `mmid` row-packing (sort/gather rows by expert so
each expert gets one contiguous GEMM) — **it does not**: infr already packs
(`moe_bucket_count` → `_scan` → `_scatter`, expert id on `gl_WorkGroupID.y`), and
the whole packing pipeline costs **3.6% of GPU time**. There was nothing to win
there.

The real waste: a tile was only skipped *wholesale* when its first row was past
the expert's segment. Inside a **partial** tile, rows past the segment end still
ran the full dp4a k-loop and had their results thrown away by the clipped store.
At 128 experts × top-8 that is ~32 routed rows in a BM=64 tile — **half of every
tile computing garbage**. A `live` row mask around the dp4a (staging and both
barriers stay unconditional, so no divergent barrier) drops it.

The instructive part is the **null result**: the obvious fix — shrink the tile to
BM=32 to match the ~32 real rows — is exactly **backwards**, measuring a **15.4%
LOSS** (BM=32/BN=64: 3054 → 2584). BM=64 at ~32 rows/expert gives exactly one row
tile per expert, so each expert's weight bank is staged **once** — the floor. BM=32
adds a second row tile for any expert over 32 rows, and every row tile re-stages
the whole (much larger) weight bank. **The GEMM is weight-staging bound, not math
bound**; masking drops the dead math *without* paying the re-stage. A BN=128 wide-N
tile also ships, gated on `k <= 1024`: it helps the shallow-k `down` proj
(`expert_down` 56.7 → 50.0 ms) but **hurts** the deep-k `gate`/`up` proj
(`expert_gateup` 65.0 → 69.2 ms), so applying it unconditionally would have been a
wash that slowed the dominant op. `pp512`: Qwen3-30B-A3B 0.95× → **1.09×**,
Gemma-4-26B-A4B 1.07× → **1.15×**.

The MoE expert kernel floor (the id-indexed GEMV family every MoE model needs
for decode) now covers **every weight dtype the dense Vulkan path supports** —
all quants (Q\* incl. ternary Q2_0, K-quants, IQ\*, TQ\*, MXFP4/NVFP4, BF16)
plus F16/F32 float banks — so no expert-bank quant is rejected at load. On top
of that, the batched-MoE dp4a mmq prefill family covers Q4_0 / Q4_1 / Q5_0 /
Q5_1 / Q8_0 / Q2_0 / Q2_K / Q3_K / Q4_K / Q5_K / Q6_K / IQ4_NL / IQ4_XS / MXFP4
/ NVFP4 (`infr_core::tensor::MOE_MMQ_DTYPES` is the single source of truth both
the graph-build and adapter gates derive from; `moe_mmq_drift_test` guards the
kernel tables against drift, and its doc records the deliberate exclusions: grid
i-quants (IQ1–IQ3), ternary (TQ\*), and float banks prefill via the per-token
id-GEMV path).

**Where infr wins.** **Prefill on every row**: `pp4@d4096` (multi-turn ingest —
the shape a coding agent actually runs) wins on **all 35 rows**, 1.05–2.16×, and
`pp512` wins on every row but one (Gemma-4-31B 0.98×, inside noise). Decode is now
a win or a tie on **30 of 35 rows**, including the whole 8B–27B band, both gemma
MoEs (1.13×), the DeltaNet 35Bs (1.04–1.05×) and the Qwen3.6-35B MoE (1.03×).

### MTP is parked

**MTP self-speculative decode is DISABLED** (`infr_llama::mtp::mtp_enabled` is
the single kill-switch, and carries the full rationale). `INFR_MTP=1` is ignored
with a warning, and the MTP-head GGUFs (Qwen3.5-\*-MTP) run the **ordinary**
decode path — their `nextn` tensors are simply unused, which is harmless. Those
models are otherwise fully supported; only the speculative path is off.

Why: MTP's contract was that its output is **token-identical to non-speculative
greedy** — a pure speedup, not a quality trade. That no longer holds. The
int8-activation decode kernels every fast dtype now uses carry small per-token
rounding noise, and MTP's verify batch and the plain-decode chain it must match
are computed at **different sequence positions with different KV state**. The
same noise plain decode absorbs harmlessly is enough to flip a close-margin
greedy argmax between the two streams, so `mtp_spec_matches_target_only_greedy`
fails. Notably this is **not** a bit-identity bug (`mmv_row1_bit_identical`
passes — decode and verify share one kernel) and **not** an accuracy cliff (all
13 `gpu_seam_matches_cpu_*` pass; output stays coherent).

That guarantee was holding the rest of the engine hostage: it blocked Q6_K's int8
decode tier (+10% decode, +34% prefill) on a speculative path that was already
our slowest row (0.59–0.78× vs llama.cpp). So MTP is parked and the kernel wins
ship. The identity test is `#[ignore]`d, **not weakened** — the assertion is
correct; re-enabling MTP means making it pass again, which needs an accuracy
mitigation (e.g. re-verify in f32 when the top-2 logit margin is tight), not
faster kernels.

**Where infr loses.** Prefill is clean; **all five remaining losses are decode**,
and they are now specific rows rather than a broad band:

- **Qwen3-14B Q2_K** (0.85× / **0.81×**) — the worst row in the table by a clear
  margin, and the one to fix next. Successive levers have lifted it (0.74×/0.72×
  → 0.81×/0.78× via the int8 tier, → 0.85×/0.81× via the wide rmsnorm) without
  closing it. It is the only row whose gap has never been root-caused to a named
  kernel; it deserves its own profile rather than another inherited hypothesis.
- **The IQ3_S MoE** (0.93× / 0.94×) — **fully diagnosed, deliberately not fixed**:
  ~50 ms of its 505 ms decode is per-workgroup re-staging of the codebook into
  LDS (footnote ⁶). Making the codebook L2-resident should close essentially the
  whole gap, but it touches every grid GEMV variant and all 7 grid dtypes, so it
  is a campaign, not a slice.
- **BF16** (0.87× / 0.93×) — the only non-integer weight dtype in the table, so no
  unpack ALU to save and no weight codes to integer-dot. Structurally out of reach
  of everything that fixed the other rows.
- **Qwen3-30B-A3B** (0.99× / 0.95×) and **Qwen3-14B Q4_K_M** (0.95× at depth) —
  what is left of the old mid/large band after the rmsnorm fix. Both are now
  within a few percent, and both are `tg64@d4096`-only (their `tg128` is a win or
  a tie), which points at attention/KV at depth rather than the GEMV.
- **Llama-3.2-1B / Gemma-4-E2B `tg64@d4096`** (0.91–0.99×) — isolated small-model
  rows; their other three columns are wins.

**A loss the table does not show.** `infr compare`'s deep-context turn shapes
(16k–32k KV, beyond this table's 4096) still lose on the MoE rows and get
**monotonically worse with depth** — Qwen3-30B-A3B `pg8192,512`: 0.88× @8k, 0.80×
@16k, **0.74× @32k**. The published table tops out at d4096 and so flatters us at
exactly the shape a long-lived agent session actually reaches. Untriaged; likely
the most valuable open item here.

**DiffusionGemma** (`dg-step`) beats the reference fork at 1.23× (this sweep;
previously 1.18×).

**Ternary-Bonsai (Q2_0) — infr is the only engine that runs these on a GPU.**
llama.cpp merged the **Q2_0** weight dtype (GGML type 42) but shipped **no GPU
kernels for it**: there is not a single `q2_0` reference in its `ggml-vulkan/`
or `ggml-cuda/` trees, so every backend but CPU refuses to load these files.
infr runs Q2_0 natively on Vulkan (in-shader dequant + dp4a mmq — `ad89fb4`), so
the comparison below is **absolute throughput on different devices, not a
like-for- like ratio**: infr on the RX 7900 XTX vs llama.cpp on a Ryzen 9
9950X3D (16 threads, Release + `GGML_NATIVE`). r=3, 2026-07-12.

Use the **`Q2_0_g64`** files — despite the name they are the layout upstream
merged (64-elem / 18 B blocks, 2.25 bpw). The repos' plain `*-Q2_0.gguf` /
`*-PQ2_0.gguf` uploads predate the merge and use 128-elem / 34 B blocks (2.125
bpw); llama.cpp master rejects them too. Same scheme otherwise — one f16 scale
per 128 weights instead of per 64 — so they could be supported by a lossless
load-time repack if the format sticks around.

```bash
infr run prism-ml/Ternary-Bonsai-8B-gguf:Q2_0_g64 "What is the capital of France?"
```

**Llama-4-Scout** (109B-A17B, Q2_K, 37 GB) is deliberately absent from the table
above (its per-token small-m dispatch shape isn't comparable to the batched
pp/tg columns) but runs end to end on a 24 GB card via the paged expert cache
(`infr_vulkan::pager`). Prefill runs the batched bucket-scatter dp4a mmq
expert-GEMM pipeline against the pager arena with NO host round-trip at all:
each layer pre-stages its full expert set through a pipelined staging ring
(recorded ring→arena copies, fenced half rotation — CPU expert memcpys overlap
GPU execution) under a scan-resistant eviction policy, and every paged dispatch
reads a frozen per-layer LUT window from a tape instead of a live LUT. Decode
keeps the id-indexed small-m GEMV with at most ONE mapped-readback sync per
non-resident layer (fully-resident layers record straight through). Greedy
output is oracle-locked against llama.cpp (`cpu_llama4_scout_greedy`) AND
against the paged Vulkan path itself
(`gpu_seam_paged_moe_matches_scout_oracle`), token-for-token identical. Measured
(all 48 expert layers paged, per-role LRU caches of 312/312/238 experts — each
role's arena is one SSBO, capped at the device's 4 GiB binding range): `pp512`
**404 t/s** warm (r=3; pre-rework host-orchestration baseline: 189; llama.cpp's
CPU-offload hybrid: 136 — and past the ~363 t/s-equivalent GPU-busy ceiling the
old per-layer submit→readback→upload cadence measured, since staging now
overlaps compute), warm decode `tg64@d128` **~17 t/s** (baseline 14.2; llama.cpp
hybrid: 6.55 — decode stays upload-bound: a 24 GB budget can't hold the ~37 GB
decode working set, so ~350 MB/token still pages in). `INFR_CACHE` sizes the
pager's budget (see the MoE placement paragraph above); `INFR_PAGER_RING`
overrides the staging-ring size (default: budget/8 clamped to [256 MiB, 2 GiB]);
pure CPU stays available under `INFR_CPU=1` / `-ngl 0`. Remaining follow-up:
splitting a role across several arena buffers to lift the 4 GiB per-role cache
cap.

**Also validated for correctness** (GPU seam vs CPU reference), beyond the perf
table: Qwen2-0.5B, Llama-3.2-1B, Gemma-4-12B (dense), and Qwen3-0.6B across
quant formats **Q4_K_M / Q5_K_M / Q6_K / Q4_0 / Q2_K / IQ4_XS / Q8_0 / BF16**
(each decoded on-device via hand-written SPIR-V, byte-identical to the CPU
dequant).

## Scope

- **Format:** GGUF
- **Models:** Llama, Qwen2/2.5, Qwen3 (dense + MoE), Gemma 3, Gemma 4 (dense +
  E2B + 26B-A4B MoE), Qwen3.5/3.6 (dense + MoE) — all on GPU **and** the CPU
  reference; DiffusionGemma (block text-diffusion, CPU + GPU); Llama 4 (Scout —
  GPU by default via the paged expert cache, 37 GB Q2_K on a 24 GB card; pure
  CPU under `INFR_CPU=1`)
- **GPU:** AMD / NVIDIA / Intel via Vulkan (cooperative-matrix matmul); Apple
  via a native **Metal backend** (`INFR_METAL=1`) covering every op the CPU
  reference does — dense, MoE (`qwen3moe`) and Qwen3.5 (`qwen35`). Dense is
  optimized (simdgroup-matrix GEMM + flash attention, raw-block quant decode;
  within ~1.3-1.5× of llama.cpp Metal on M3 Pro — architecture and numbers in
  [`docs/METAL.md`](docs/METAL.md))
- **Store:** the shared **HuggingFace Hub cache** — located via `$HF_HUB_CACHE`,
  else `$HF_HOME/hub`, else `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`, in HF's own
  `models--<org>--<repo>/{blobs,snapshots,refs}` layout. A model pulled by
  `infr`, `llama.cpp`, or `huggingface_hub` is shared — downloaded once.
  `infr pull` fetches from `huggingface.co` over resumable HTTP Range with a
  progress bar; gated repos authenticate with `HF_TOKEN`.
- **API:** OpenAI-compatible HTTP (streaming) — works with opencode / Claude
  Code CLI
