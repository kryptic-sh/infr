//! Backend-agnostic compute IR.
//!
//! The model layer builds a [`Graph`] — an explicit, ordered list of semantic [`Op`]s over
//! typed [`TensorId`] handles — and a [`crate::backend::Backend`] compiles + executes it
//! however it likes (Vulkan SPIR-V, CPU loops, Metal MSL). See docs/plan.md
//! "The backend abstraction".
//!
//! ## Why an op-list, not a pure DAG
//!
//! The real transformer forward is imperative: it reuses scratch buffers, RoPEs in place, and
//! writes K/V into a persistent cache at a running offset. A pure SSA DAG can't express those
//! aliasing/stateful writes cleanly, so [`Graph`] is an **ordered list** of ops, each naming the
//! tensor handles it reads and the handle it writes (`dst`). Two ops may legally write the same
//! handle (in-place / scratch reuse) — order is significant, exactly like a command buffer.
//!
//! ## Composite ops
//!
//! Ops are *composite/semantic* (e.g. [`Op::Attention`], [`Op::QkNorm`]) rather than scalar
//! primitives, so a GPU backend can map each one straight to a hand-fused kernel (no perf loss)
//! while a CPU backend runs a plain loop. A future backend may either implement the composites
//! directly or add a lowering pass that decomposes them into primitives.
