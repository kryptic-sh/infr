//! On-disk `vkPipelineCache` persistence. Pipeline creation (`vkCreateComputePipelines`) is the
//! driver's GPU-specific codegen and was measured at ~5s across a cold DG forward's kernel set —
//! all one-time work that previously re-ran every process launch (we passed
//! `vk::PipelineCache::null()` everywhere and relied incidentally on Mesa's own shader cache,
//! which softens but does not eliminate it). This module seeds ONE `vk::PipelineCache` from a
//! per-device file at backend init and writes it back (debounced, and finally on drop), so every
//! launch after the first creates pipelines from cached binaries.
//!
//! Invalidation is three-layer:
//! - The DRIVER validates its own header inside the blob (vendor/device/driverVersion/cacheUUID)
//!   and silently ignores data it can't use — so a driver upgrade never corrupts, at worst it
//!   recompiles once and the next save replaces the file.
//! - OUR envelope carries the build-time SHADER_SET_FINGERPRINT (FNV-1a over every compiled
//!   SPIR-V blob — see build.rs): any shader change discards the old file WHOLESALE instead of
//!   letting entries for retired pipeline variants accumulate in the blob forever.
//! - OUR envelope also carries an FNV-1a CHECKSUM of the payload, verified on load. What lands in
//!   this file is driver-authored machine code that we hand straight back to the driver, and
//!   `vkCreatePipelineCache`'s contract is explicit that invalid data is allowed to produce
//!   UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR — on a GPU that means a hung ring, not a clean error. A truncated or
//!   bit-rotted file must therefore die HERE, at a cheap one-time recompile, rather than reach
//!   the driver. (Mesa/RADV happens to hash its own cache objects and drop the ones that don't
//!   validate — measured: a blob with 25% of its payload bytes scrambled still ran correctly —
//!   so this layer is defense-in-depth against a less careful driver, not a load-bearing fix for
//!   any failure observed on RADV.)
//!
//! Writes are atomic AND durable: the payload is written to a unique per-save temp file
//! (`<cache>.tmp.<pid>.<seq>`, so two concurrent saves in one process never share a path), `fsync`ed,
//! then `rename`d over the target, and the directory entry is `fsync`ed too. `rename` alone is only
//! atomic with respect to a concurrent READER — on a crash/power-loss it can leave the new name
//! pointing at an inode whose data blocks were never flushed (ext4 delayed allocation), i.e. a
//! valid-looking file over garbage. The checksum above would catch that; the fsync keeps it from
//! happening at all.
//!
//! ── THE TRIPWIRE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//!
//! None of the above can catch the failure that actually happened: a blob that is perfectly
//! WELL-FORMED but contains a shader binary that HANGS THE GPU. (Real incident: a hung
//! `native_idm_q5k_sg2` sat in this file and was re-seeded on every launch, so a 35B MoE returned
//! all-zero logits or a device-lost — surviving reboots, reproducing at CI-green commits, and
//! ignoring every code knob, because the poison was on DISK, not in the tree.) A checksum sees
//! only the bytes we wrote, and they are exactly the bytes we wrote. RADV already hashes its own
//! cache entries and drops damaged ones, so corruption was never the mechanism.
//!
//! So instead of validating the CONTENT, watch what HAPPENS after we hand it to the driver — the
//! same dirty-bit trick a filesystem uses:
//!
//! 1. When a run seeds the driver from a loaded blob, drop a marker file next to it.
//! 2. On a clean exit (device NOT lost), delete the marker.
//! 3. If a marker from a DEAD process is found at startup, that run seeded from this blob and then
//!    died without a clean exit. The blob is not trustworthy: delete it and recompile.
//!
//! That closes the loop the incident was stuck in — a poisoned blob hangs the GPU, the run dies
//! with a lost device, the marker survives, and the NEXT launch throws the blob away. One slow
//! start instead of a hang that reproduces forever.
//!
//! The false positive is deliberate and cheap: any unclean death (a crash, a power cut, SIGKILL)
//! discards a perfectly good cache and costs one cold pipeline build. The asymmetry is total —
//! the other mistake is an undebuggable GPU hang, so we take the recompile every time.
//!
//! Markers are keyed PER-BACKEND-INSTANCE (`<cache>.seeded.<pid>-<nonce>`) and a marker is only
//! stale if its PROCESS is GONE, so neither a second `infr` running concurrently (a `serve`
//! alongside a CLI run) NOR a sibling backend in the same process (an MTP bench loop) is mistaken
//! for a crashed one — and one backend's clean drop only disarms ITS OWN marker, never a live
//! sibling's.
//!
//! `INFR_NO_PIPELINE_CACHE=1` disables persistence (the in-process cache handle still works).
