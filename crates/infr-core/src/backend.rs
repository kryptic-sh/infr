//! The compute backend seam — the ONLY device-aware trait. Everything above is generic over it.
//!
//! Object-safe on purpose so the engine can hold `Arc<dyn Backend>` and stay blind to whether
//! Vulkan / CPU / CUDA / ROCm / Metal / MLX is underneath. See docs/PLAN.md.
//!
//! ## Execution model
//!
//! 1. The model builds a [`Graph`] (op-list) once per forward *shape* and `compile`s it to a
//!    [`Plan`] (pipelines, buffer-size planning, recorded command buffer for Vulkan).
//! 2. The model owns long-lived buffers (weights, KV cache) and per-step input/output buffers,
//!    and binds them to the graph's `Input`/`Weight`/`Output` handles via [`Bindings`].
//! 3. `execute(plan, bindings)` allocates the graph's `Internal` scratch, runs the ops, and
//!    writes results into the bound `Output` buffers. `Internal`/`Output` scratch is transient.
