//! The `general.architecture` strings infr supports — the single source of truth, replacing
//! magic strings scattered through dispatch code.
//!
//! These strings live INSIDE the GGUF (written by llama.cpp's `convert_hf_to_gguf.py`) and are
//! load-bearing twice over: the engine dispatches on the exact string, and the string namespaces
//! every model-metadata key (`{arch}.block_count`, `{arch}.embedding_length`, …). They must match
//! llama.cpp's canonical `LLM_ARCH_NAMES` table verbatim — never invent a name; audit new entries
//! against `llama.cpp/src/llama-arch.cpp` and a real converted GGUF.
//!
//! Beware the neighboring GGUF namespaces that reuse the same literals with DIFFERENT meanings:
//! `tokenizer.ggml.model == "llama"` means SentencePiece (a tokenizer family, not the arch), and
//! `tokenizer.ggml.pre == "qwen2"` names a pre-tokenizer regex. Those sites intentionally do NOT
//! use these constants.
