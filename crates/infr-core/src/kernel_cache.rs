//! A shared on-disk cache for COMPILED KERNEL ARTIFACTS — the backend-agnostic half of what
//! `infr-vulkan/src/pcache.rs` grew for `vkPipelineCache`.
//!
//! Every GPU backend pays the same tax: turning our kernel source into machine code is expensive,
//! one-time, and re-runs on every process launch unless somebody writes the result down. Measured
//! on this box: ~5 s of `vkCreateComputePipelines` across a cold DG forward's kernel set (Vulkan).
//!
//! # What a cached artifact is allowed to do
//!
//! Nothing here is a general-purpose blob store. What lands in these files is MACHINE CODE that we
//! hand straight back to a driver, and every driver's contract for "cached binaries" is the same:
//! data it cannot validate is allowed to produce UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR. On a GPU that reads as a hung
//! ring, not a clean error. **A cache must never be able to produce a wrong result silently** — so
//! the rule is that a damaged, stale, or merely SUSPECT file must die HERE, at the cost of one cold
//! recompile, rather than reach the device.
//!
//! Three layers enforce that, and a fourth catches what none of them can:
//!
//! - **The KEY.** [`open`](KernelCache::open) takes an opaque byte string that is compared
//!   VERBATIM on load. The caller folds in everything that would make an old artifact wrong:
//!   Vulkan carries `driverVersion ++ pipelineCacheUUID ++ SHADER_SET_FINGERPRINT`. A mismatch
//!   discards the file WHOLESALE, which is also why the key is not a hash we compute for the
//!   caller: only the caller knows what its artifact depends on.
//! - **The ENVELOPE.** `magic ++ format_version ++ key_len ++ payload_len ++ payload_hash`, so a
//!   file from another producer, an older layout, or a truncated write is rejected on sight. The
//!   `magic` is the producer's identity AND its layout version — bump it and every old file is
//!   rejected cleanly instead of being misread.
//! - **The CHECKSUM.** FNV-1a over the payload, verified on load, because `rename` is atomic only
//!   with respect to a concurrent READER: on a crash/power-loss it can publish a name over data
//!   blocks that were never flushed (ext4 delayed allocation), i.e. a valid-looking file over
//!   garbage. [`store`](KernelCache::store) `fsync`s to keep that from happening at all; the
//!   checksum is what catches it if it happens anyway.
//! - **The TRIPWIRE** — see below.
//!
//! # Durability
//!
//! [`store`](KernelCache::store) writes to a UNIQUE per-save temp path (`<path>.tmp.<pid>.<seq>`,
//! from a monotonic per-process counter, so two concurrent saves never share a path and neither
//! clobbers the other's in-flight bytes), `fsync`s the file, `rename`s it over the target, then
//! `fsync`s the DIRECTORY so the new entry survives a crash too.
//!
//! # ── THE TRIPWIRE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//!
//! None of the above can catch the failure that actually happened: a blob that is perfectly
//! WELL-FORMED but contains a kernel binary that HANGS THE GPU. (Real incident: a hung
//! `native_idm_q5k_sg2` sat in the Vulkan pipeline cache and was re-seeded on every launch, so a
//! 35B MoE returned all-zero logits or a device-lost — surviving reboots, reproducing at CI-green
//! commits, and ignoring every code knob, because the poison was on DISK, not in the tree.) A
//! checksum sees only the bytes we wrote, and they are exactly the bytes we wrote.
//!
//! So instead of validating the CONTENT, watch what HAPPENS after we hand it to the driver — the
//! same dirty-bit trick a filesystem uses:
//!
//! 1. When a run seeds a driver from a loaded blob, drop a marker file next to it
//!    ([`load`](KernelCache::load) arms it BEFORE returning the payload, so a hang in the very call
//!    that consumes it is still attributable).
//! 2. On a clean exit, delete the marker ([`disarm`](KernelCache::disarm)).
//! 3. If a marker from a DEAD process is found at startup, that run seeded from this blob and then
//!    died without a clean exit. The blob is not trustworthy: delete it and recompile.
//!
//! That closes the loop the incident was stuck in — a poisoned blob hangs the GPU, the run dies
//! with a lost device, the marker survives, and the NEXT launch throws the blob away. One slow
//! start instead of a hang that reproduces forever.
//!
//! The false positive is deliberate and cheap: any unclean death (a crash, a power cut, SIGKILL)
//! discards a perfectly good cache and costs one cold compile. The asymmetry is total — the other
//! mistake is an undebuggable GPU hang, so we take the recompile every time.
//!
//! Markers are keyed PER-INSTANCE (`<path>.seeded.<pid>-<nonce>`) and a marker is only stale if its
//! PROCESS is GONE, so neither a second `infr` running concurrently (a `serve` alongside a CLI run)
//! NOR a sibling backend in the same process (an MTP bench loop, a Vulkan+CPU parity run) is
//! mistaken for a crashed one — and one instance's clean [`disarm`](KernelCache::disarm) only
//! removes ITS OWN marker, never a live sibling's.
//!
//! # Disabled
//!
//! A cache opened with `enabled = false` (`kernels.vulkan.pipeline_cache_disk = false`)
//! is a TOTAL no-op: it never creates the cache directory,
//! never reads, never writes, never sweeps. Every method returns the miss/OK answer immediately.
