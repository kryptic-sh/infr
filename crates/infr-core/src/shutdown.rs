//! The process-wide graceful-shutdown latch (SIGINT / SIGTERM).
//!
//! **Why this exists.** A GPU submit is not cancellable. Once a command buffer is on the queue the
//! only legal thing a host can do is WAIT for its fence — and if the process dies first, the kernel
//! is left holding a fence nobody will ever reap. On amdgpu that is not theoretical: a `SIGTERM`
//! delivered while an `infr` prefill submit was in flight on an integrated part left the task
//! unkillable in `D` state inside `drm_suballoc_insert` (the queued `SIGKILL` is never delivered
//! because the thread is blocked in the kernel on a GPU fence), and its buffer objects were never
//! released — the whole 2 GiB carveout plus 7.2 GiB of GTT stayed pinned by a dead process, so
//! every subsequent client got `ENOMEM` opening the render node and the GPU vanished from Vulkan
//! enumeration until a reboot. Two `amdgpu_gpu_recover` cycles did not free it.
//!
//! There are driver bugs under that, but the loaded gun is ours: `infr` installed no signal
//! handlers at all, so the default disposition (terminate immediately) fired mid-ioctl. The fix is
//! this latch:
//!
//! * The CLI's signal handler does exactly ONE thing — [`request_shutdown`], a lock-free atomic
//!   compare-exchange. Nothing else in the handler is async-signal-safe, so nothing else is in it.
//! * Everything that can issue GPU work polls [`shutdown_requested`] at the boundary where it is
//!   about to submit MORE work, and stops there. Work already submitted is always drained
//!   (`vkQueueWaitIdle` / fence wait) — never abandoned.
//! * Nobody calls `std::process::exit` on that path. The stack unwinds, the backend's `Drop` runs,
//!   `vkDestroyDevice` happens, and the kernel gets its buffer objects back.
//!
//! The latch is process-wide and monotonic (it never un-sets): the only thing it means is "this
//! process is on its way out, stop starting things". It is deliberately NOT the per-request abort
//! (`infr_llama::sampling::RequestCtx::abort`, which one `serve` request latches when its stop
//! sequence hits) — but that request-level poll ORs this one in, so every existing poll site
//! inherits process shutdown for free.
//!
//! `Relaxed` ordering throughout: there is no other data to publish (the flag IS the message), and
//! a poll loop that observes it one iteration late is fine — the guarantee is "stops promptly", not
//! "stops instantly".
