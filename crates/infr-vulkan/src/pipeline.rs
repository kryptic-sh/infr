//! Pipeline (layer-split) multi-GPU: run ONE model's transformer layers split across several
//! physical Vulkan devices so a model too big for one device's VRAM can run, handing the hidden
//! state across the device boundary.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! [`PipelineBackend`] implements [`infr_core::backend::Backend`] by owning N real
//! [`VulkanBackend`]s (one per physical device) and transparently SPLITTING each compiled graph by
//! layer: layers `[0..k)` run on device A, `[k..N)` on device B (generalized to a device list).
//! Weights and KV for a layer live on the device that runs it; the residual hidden state is handed
//! device A→B at the split (host-less P2P over dma-buf when available, host-bounce otherwise). The
//! model runner (`generate_dense_backend`) is UNCHANGED — it drives this exactly like a single
//! backend; the split is invisible above the `Backend` seam.
//!
//! # How placement works (no runner change)
//!
//! * **Weights** are placed by tensor NAME through a device-aware binder the caller builds (see
//!   `infr_llama::seam::pipeline_binder`): `blk.{l}.*` → device of layer `l`, `output*`/final norm
//!   → last device. Each returns a single-device [`PipelineBuffer`], so an op that reads it is
//!   pinned to that device.
//! * **KV** (`alloc(KvCache)`) is placed per-layer by the strictly-ordered `(k,v)`-pair alloc
//!   counter — the runner allocs `kbufs[l]` then `vbufs[l]` for `l = 0..n_layer`, so alloc pair `l`
//!   is layer `l`.
//! * **IO** — the host-embedded `hidden` residual, `positions`, the rope table, the weightless
//!   ones-vectors (`Staging`/`Weights`/`Activations`) — is REPLICATED to every device (each device
//!   reads its own copy). The residual is the one replicated buffer the ops WRITE, so it is the
//!   cut tensor handed across at each boundary; read-only replicas (positions/rope) need no handoff.
//! * **Logits** (`alloc(Readback)`) live on the last device (the LM head runs there); the runner's
//!   `download(logits)` reads that device.
//!
//! At [`PipelineBackend::execute`] each op's device is INFERRED from the device its bound
//! weight/KV operands live on (ground truth, no layer-label heuristics); pure activation ops
//! (residual `Add`, `Copy`, `Scale`) inherit the previous op's device. The ops partition into
//! contiguous per-device segments; each segment is compiled + run on its device, and the cut
//! tensor(s) are transferred between segments with a host-fence sync.
//!
//! # Scope (v1, correctness-first)
//!
//! `capabilities()` reports the fancy GPU-resident features OFF (`embed_gather`/`decode_replay`/
//! `gpu_sample`/argmax), so the runner takes the classic host-embed + host-sample + static
//! per-token `execute` path — which keeps `hidden` a bound Input (handoff-able) and every step a
//! plain `execute`. Dense attention models only; MoE-paged / dense-streaming are disabled. The
//! split output is BIT-IDENTICAL to the same model run single-device: identical ops, identical
//! per-device kernels (the same [`VulkanBackend`] code on each device), only the boundary residual
//! crosses via a value-preserving copy.
