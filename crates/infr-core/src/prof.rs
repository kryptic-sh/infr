//! The per-op profiling seam: ONE collector, ONE label grammar, ONE report, for every backend.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Per-op profiling was re-invented once per backend. Every backend could answer "where did the
//! forward go", and every backend answered it in its own dialect: vulkan stamped timestamp queries
//! and printed `[prof2]`, metal accumulated host
//! encode wall and printed `── infr-metal profile`, cpu summed `Instant`s and printed `[prof-ops]`.
//! Three knobs (`INFR_PROF2`, `INFR_METAL_PROFILE`, `INFR_PROF_OPS`), three
//! label grammars, three sort orders, three notions of what the total is a percentage OF. All three
//! are now [`ProfCfg::ops`](crate::config::ProfCfg::ops) — one knob, `INFR_PROF_OPS`.
//!
//! That is worse than untidy. It cost real work:
//!
//! * Metal's table counted the **untimed warmup forward**. Only vulkan honored the
//!   suppression flag, so on the others the published share was diluted by work the bench
//!   itself excluded.
//! * Only vulkan fed [`infr_prof_rt`], so only vulkan appeared in the exit aggregate and in the
//!   `INFR_PROF_OUT` JSON. Correlating a host function table against device op time was a
//!   vulkan-only capability by accident, not by design.
//!
//! ## What is shared and what deliberately is not
//!
//! Shared here: the ACCOUNTING and the OUTPUT — `OpProf` (label → count + µs, folded into the
//! process aggregate and printed in one format), `op_label` (what two dispatches must agree on to
//! share a row), and `enabled` (the one predicate that decides whether to profile at all,
//! including the warmup-suppression AND).
//!
//! NOT shared, on purpose: **how a backend obtains a duration.** Those differ for hardware reasons,
//! not drift, and flattening them would silently degrade two of the three:
//!
//! * vulkan writes `BOTTOM_OF_PIPE` timestamps into a query pool and reads the whole pool back
//!   after the submit completes.
//! * metal has no free per-op device timing at all: its ops batch into one command buffer, so
//!   isolating an op's GPU wall means flushing after it (`prof.metal_device_time=flush`, which
//!   costs the batching) or sampling stage-boundary counters (`=counters`). Its cheap default mode
//!   measures host ENCODE time, which is a different quantity and is labeled as such.
//! * cpu measures host wall directly, which for a host backend IS the device time.
//!
//! So each backend keeps its own timing acquisition and calls `OpProf::add` with the result. The
//! unit is microseconds everywhere — the conversion belongs at the acquisition site, where the
//! clock's native unit is known (vulkan ticks × `timestamp_period`,
//! host `Duration`s).
