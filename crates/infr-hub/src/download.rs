/// present. Returns `(blob_path, hex_digest, total_bytes)`. On a transport error the partial temp file
/// is KEPT so a later call resumes from where it stopped.
///
/// When `expected_sha` is `Some`, it is HF's advertised LFS sha256 and is used two ways: the download
/// is skipped entirely if that content-addressed blob is already on disk, and the downloaded bytes are
/// verified against it before the blob is committed — a mismatch discards the temp and errors (a
/// corrupt/truncated body, or a resume of a stale partial from a since-changed file, must never be
/// linked as the model). `None` (non-LFS file / no digest available) proceeds without verification.
///
/// `max_bytes` caps the FINAL size of the file (resumed prefix included) and is enforced INSIDE the
/// streaming loop, so an over-long body is aborted mid-transfer instead of after it has already
/// landed on disk — the whole point of a cap on an unverified download. `None` means uncapped and
/// is what the model-blob path passes: a GGUF is legitimately multi-GB, and its integrity comes
/// from `expected_sha` instead. See [`crate::pull::MAX_COMPANION_BYTES`] for the only capped
/// caller. The advertised `Content-Length` is checked first as a courtesy (fail before writing a
/// byte) but is never trusted on its own — it is attacker-controlled and may be absent under
/// chunked encoding, which is exactly why the loop counts for itself.
///
/// `progress` owns the bar's line. Several of these run at once (one per shard), so the bar joins a
/// group rather than addressing the terminal itself — see [`infr_core::progress::group`]. There is
/// ONE bar per file however many connections carry it: a ranged download's chunk workers all
/// advance the same line, because "which slice of shard 3 is at 40%" is not a thing anyone wants
/// eight lines of.
///
/// `budget` is the pull's whole allowance of simultaneous connections ([`ConnBudget`]). A single
/// large file spends what the file fan-out left over on fetching ITSELF in parallel; when there is
/// nothing spare — `hub.pull_jobs = 1`, or a 236-shard repo with every permit already on a file —
/// the download is one stream, exactly as before.
///
/// The HF bearer token ([`crate::http::token`]) is attached when the environment carries one, so a
/// gated repo works the same on this path as on the metadata calls.
