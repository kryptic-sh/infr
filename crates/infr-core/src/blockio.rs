//! Reading one pageable block's bytes off the model file — the bottom tier of the weight pager
//! (`docs/disk-streaming-plan.md` §3.2, §3.5).
//!
//! What a block IS lives in [`crate::pager`] (an opaque `BlockId` plus residency bookkeeping);
//! what a block's bytes ARE lives here: a [`BlockDesc`] naming one or more byte ranges of the
//! model file, in upload order, and a [`BlockIo`] that fills a caller's slot from them.
//!
//! Positioned reads, never a shared cursor: [`FileBlockIo`] reads at an explicit offset
//! (`pread`/`seek_read`), so any number of reader threads share one open file with no seek race
//! and no lock. This is the deliberate alternative to reaching through the GGUF mmap — the page
//! cache evicts by recency, which is the pathological policy for the cyclic sweep a forward pass
//! performs (measured: `docs/perf/results.md`, "Weights that do not fit memory").
//!
//! A `gguf-split` model is several files rather than one, and they are addressed end to end in
//! shard order ([`FileBlockIo::open_shards`]) so a [`BlockExtent`] stays one number. A single-file
//! model is the one-shard case of that, at base 0, and reads exactly as it did before.
//!
//! That freedom is also what makes a block's read CONCURRENT rather than one syscall: an NVMe
//! reaches its bandwidth only with several requests in flight, so one block is split across
//! [`IO_FANOUT`] positioned reads (see [`read_pieces`]). This is what puts the tier's reader on
//! even footing with the mapping it replaces, whose faults the kernel already issues in parallel.
//!
//! The file can also change under a live run. A mapping makes that a `SIGBUS` or silently
//! different bytes; explicit reads make it detectable, so [`FileBlockIo`] stamps the file at open
//! and [`FileBlockIo::verify_unchanged`] re-checks the SAME descriptor (never the path — `infr
//! pull` renames into place, which leaves this fd on the intact old inode; see backlog B30).
