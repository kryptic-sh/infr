//! A local stand-in for huggingface.co, so the download path can be tested against real sockets.
//!
//! Resume, the sha256 gate and the concurrency bound are all properties of what goes over the
//! wire — a fake at the `reqwest` level would test the fake. This serves the two routes the hub
//! actually uses (`HEAD`/`GET /<repo>/resolve/main/<file>`) on `127.0.0.1`, and records what it
//! saw: how many bodies were in flight at once, and which byte offset each `Range` resumed from.
//!
//! A body is held for [`BODY_DELAY`] before a byte of it is written. Without that pause a 40 KB
//! file over loopback completes inside one scheduler slice and every request looks sequential no
//! matter how many workers are running — which is the observation the bound test rests on. Holding
//! it BEFORE the write, rather than dribbling the body out afterwards, is what keeps the count
//! honest at the other end too: the slot is released while the client is still reading, so two
//! strictly sequential requests can never appear to overlap.
