//! DiffusionGemma denoise graph that latency (and the deque/epoch plumbing measured at ~6% of
//! thread-time) is pure overhead. This pool keeps `N-1` workers alive across the whole graph:
//! a job is handed off by bumping a generation counter the workers spin on (~1µs handoff while
//! hot), tasks are claimed dynamically with a `fetch_add` cursor (straggler-proof), and workers
//! park after a short spin budget so an idle pool costs nothing (the host self-conditioning gap
//! between denoise steps, rayon-side MoeFfn work, and plain idle all put them to sleep).
//!
//! Scheduling only — every converted call site runs the exact same per-row math in the same
//! order as its rayon predecessor, so outputs are bit-identical.

//! Clearing `kernels.cpu.spinpool` routes `run` through rayon instead
//! (A/B + escape hatch).
