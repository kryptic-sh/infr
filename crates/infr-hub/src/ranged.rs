//! Intra-file parallelism: ONE object fetched over several connections at once, as a grid of
//! byte ranges, with [`crate::parts`]'s sidecar recording which cells have landed.
//!
//! The reason this exists is the same measurement that motivated fetching several shards at once —
//! a single connection to the HF CDN, not the link, is what caps a download — except that a model
//! shipped as one file (`unsloth/DeepSeek-V3.2-GGUF`'s 161 GB `UD-TQ1_0`) has no shards to spread
//! over connections. So the FILE is spread instead: worker `k` asks for `Range: bytes=A-B` and
//! `pwrite`s the reply at offset `A`, and the assembled file is byte-identical to what one stream
//! would have written.
//!
//! Three things are load-bearing, and all three are about not producing a plausible-sized file
//! assembled from two different uploads — the failure that once read as "this quant is broken" for
//! a day (memory `verify-gguf-downloads`):
//!
//!   * **Identity is checked before a resumed byte is written.** The sidecar records HF's LFS
//!     sha256 for the object it belongs to, and a run that finds a different one throws the partial
//!     away instead of continuing it. That is a content hash, so unlike an `ETag` it cannot differ
//!     merely because a different CDN edge answered.
//!   * **Every chunk request carries `If-Range` and must come back `206`** with a `Content-Range`
//!     naming exactly the bytes asked for, out of a total that still matches the plan. A `200` means
//!     the server declined the range and is offering the whole object from byte 0 — never something
//!     to write into the middle of a file.
//!   * **The sha256 gate is untouched.** Everything here is about where bytes land; whether the
//!     assembled file is the one HF advertises is still decided once, at the end, by
//!     [`crate::download`], and a mismatch still discards the temp and refuses to link it.
