/// The MTP self-speculative generation loop (issue #33, Phase 3 — see `docs/MTP.md`'s driver
/// section and `crate::seam::model::SeamModel::generate_metal_spec`, whose two-model draft/verify/
/// commit shape this mirrors for a SINGLE self-speculating trunk on the Vulkan production
/// backend). **Greedy only** (temp 0) — the commit/accept invariant below only holds at temp 0;
/// sampling-temperature support is a follow-up phase.
///
/// No cross-turn KV reuse: every call builds a FRESH trunk session + [`MtpHeadSession`] and
/// re-prefills the WHOLE (rendered, multi-turn-inclusive) prompt from scratch. `DenseSeamChat`'s
/// non-MTP path keeps a persistent per-conversation `DenseVulkanSession`; MTP's
/// win is DECODE throughput (the thing `docs/MTP.md`'s 2.0x oracle number measures), not prefill
/// reuse, so trading a little prefill cost for a MUCH simpler (and correct) session lifetime is
/// the pragmatic call this phase makes — a real persistent MTP session hits a self-referential-
/// struct problem ([`MtpHeadSession`] borrows the backend + embedding table it's built from) that
/// isn't worth solving until multi-turn MTP throughput is actually the bottleneck being chased.
///
/// ## Round structure (ported from `speculative.cpp`'s `common_speculative_impl_draft_mtp` driver
/// loop around the target decode, adapted to infr's own VERIFY primitive)
/// 1. **Prime** (once): a single batched VERIFY forward over the WHOLE prompt captures `h` for
///    EVERY prompt row in one shot (no chunked-prefill h gap for the prompt sizes this phase
///    validates — a genuinely huge prompt would need the lazy-priming fallback `docs/MTP.md`
///    sanctions instead: "MTP attention over a partial-history KV degrades gracefully"). `catch_up`
///    primes the head over the whole prompt — mirrors `mtp_head_forward_finite`'s `prime_head` test
///    helper exactly (`shifted_h[0]` zero, `pending_h` = the last row).
/// 2. **Cycle**: `draft` up to `n_max` tokens off `(id_last, pending_h)`; one batched VERIFY over
///    `[committed | drafted]`; `crate::seam::model::spec_accept` picks the longest accepted prefix +
///    the target's correction/bonus token — EXACTLY the macOS spec driver's rule, so the same
///    "committed stream == target's own greedy argmax stream" invariant holds here.
///
/// ## The `+1` leading row, and why cycle 1 is special
/// Every cycle's VERIFY feed is `committed ++ drafted`, and `committed` always includes ONE token
/// the trunk session hasn't been fed yet (the previous cycle's correction/bonus token) — so every
/// VERIFY call after the first returns `drafted.len() + 1` rows: a leading row that re-confirms/
/// predicts `drafted[0]`, found at `base = m - (drafted.len() + 1)`. Cycle 1 has NO such leading
/// row (the prime step already verified — and cached — the WHOLE prompt, so `committed` exactly
/// equals what's cached when cycle 1's draft is proposed): its leading prediction is instead the
/// prime step's own LAST logits/h row (the prompt's last token predicting whatever comes right
/// after it), spliced in as a virtual row so the SAME accept/catch-up code handles cycle 1
/// identically to every later cycle.
///
/// ## KV-overwrite / no-rewind semantics this relies on (see `seam.rs`)
/// The trunk session's VERIFY branch always extends `cached` by the WHOLE fed suffix, accepted or
/// not (`cached.extend_from_slice(&prompt[start..])`) — a rejected draft's rows simply get
/// OVERWRITTEN by the next cycle's differing suffix, exactly like the macOS dense/attention spec
/// driver (`SeamModel::generate_metal_spec`'s own doc: "Rollback is the session prefix-diff:
/// rejected rows just get overwritten by the next round's suffix prefill"). qwen35's gated-
/// DeltaNet layers can't rewind that way (an append-only recurrent summary, not a per-position
/// cache — `docs/QWEN35.md`): the SAME `generate_dense_backend` prefix-diff logic that reuses
/// dense KV rows falls back to a FULL reprefill from position 0 whenever a cycle's committed
/// stream doesn't EXACTLY extend the trunk's cached tokens (`seam.rs`'s `start`
/// computation, the `c.qwen35` branch) — i.e. every partial/zero-accept cycle pays a full
/// re-prefill of the WHOLE conversation so far. This is an EXISTING limitation of qwen35's KV
/// reuse (predates MTP; it would bite ANY qwen35 speculative scheme, draft-model or MTP), not
/// something this phase introduces — see `INFR_MTP_TIME=1`'s per-cycle report for its measured
/// cost, and the accompanying report for whether it's the dominant cost. The head's OWN KV has no
/// such issue: `MtpHeadSession`'s attention layer is an ordinary per-position cache (`docs/MTP.md`),
/// so `catch_up` only ever (re)writes the newly-committed rows, never the whole history.
///
/// ## Perf instrumentation (`INFR_MTP_TIME=1`)
/// Prints one line per cycle (`drafted`/`accepted` counts, `draft`/`verify`/`catchup` wall time,
/// and the `build`/`exec` split `MtpHeadSession` accumulates internally — Phase 2's doc already
/// flags the head graph as rebuilding + recompiling from scratch every `forward` call, since
/// `Op::Attention::kv_len`/`Op::WriteKv::pos` are baked into the graph rather than bound inputs;
/// this is the number that quantifies that cost) plus a final aggregate-`alpha` summary. Phase 4
/// (issue #33, perf-bottleneck visibility) plumbs the SAME per-cycle sums out programmatically as
/// [`MtpTiming`] — see [`generate_mtp_spec_vulkan_timed`] — rather than adding a second stderr
/// scraper: this function is now a thin wrapper that drops the timing half of that return, so
/// `run`/`serve` (which only want [`crate::GenStats`]) and `bench`/`compare` (which want both)
/// share one implementation.
