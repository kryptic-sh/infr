//! Tensor parallelism (dense) — Megatron-style intra-op weight sharding across several physical
//! Vulkan devices, so a single autoregressive stream's weight-GEMV (decode's ~77% bottleneck) is
//! SPLIT across the devices instead of replicated. A DIFFERENT decomposition from the layer-split
//! [`crate::PipelineBackend`] (which places whole layers on whole devices and hands the residual
//! across once per boundary): TP shards EACH layer's weight matrices and reduces per layer.
//!
//! # Sharding scheme (comms-minimal — ONE all-reduce per attention + ONE per FFN, per layer)
//!
//! * **Attention** — the q/k/v projections are **column-parallel**: device `r` owns a contiguous
//!   slice of the attention HEADS (rows `[r·qrow/W, (r+1)·qrow/W)` of `attn_q.weight`, and the
//!   matching kv-head slice of `attn_k`/`attn_v`), so it computes its own heads' Q/K/V, its own
//!   RoPE/attention, and holds its own heads' KV (KV is sharded by head — no replication). The
//!   output projection `attn_output.weight` is **row-parallel** (device `r` owns input-columns
//!   `[r·qrow/W, …)`), so each device produces a PARTIAL `[tokens, n_embd]` sum → **all-reduce** →
//!   the full attention output, identical on every device.
//! * **FFN** — gate/up are **column-parallel** (each device owns a slice of the intermediate dim),
//!   down is **row-parallel** (partial `[tokens, n_embd]`) → **all-reduce**.
//! * **Everything else** (embeddings, norms, residual add, rope tables, the LM head) is REPLICATED
//!   and bit-identical on every device: the residual stream is the same on all devices after each
//!   all-reduce, so replicated ops need no communication.
//!
//! # How it stays invisible above the [`Backend`] seam
//!
//! Exactly like [`crate::PipelineBackend`], the model runner (`generate_dense_backend`) drives this
//! as ONE backend. The runner builds the ordinary single-device graph (global dims); at
//! [`TensorParallelBackend::execute`] the full graph is LOWERED once (cached in the plan) into a
//! per-rank sharded graph (sharded op dims + resized scratch decls) and split into SEGMENTS at each
//! row-parallel projection. Each segment runs on every rank; between segments the boundary partial
//! is all-reduced. The lowering derives each op's shard treatment from the DEVICE ROLE of its bound
//! weight (column/row/replicated — attached by the TP binder) forward-propagated through the
//! activation tensors, so no op-label heuristics are needed.
//!
//! # The all-reduce (the optimization-critical piece)
//!
//! Data crosses devices via the host-LESS P2P dma-buf transport ([`crate::VulkanBackend::p2p_export`]
//! / [`p2p_import`](crate::VulkanBackend::p2p_import)), never a host bounce. Cross-device ordering is
//! by `VK_KHR_external_semaphore_fd` when the device pair supports it (device B's read waits on
//! device A's GPU-side signal with NO host round-trip — see [`crate::tp_allreduce`]); a device pair
//! that can't import an external semaphore falls back to the host-fence (`queue_wait_idle`) path,
//! which is reported as the per-layer host-stall perf gap. Two sync points per layer (one after
//! attn-O, one after FFN-down); the reduction is a fixed device-order sum so it is deterministic
//! run-to-run.
//!
//! # Scope (v1, correctness-first)
//!
//! Dense attention models only (Qwen3/Llama/Gemma-dense); MoE / qwen35 DeltaNet / gemma-E2B /
//! diffusion-gemma are rejected up front (they need per-op sharding beyond this slice). The
//! GPU-resident fast paths (decode replay / embed-gather / gpu-sample / argmax) AND the fused
//! qkv / gate-up weight concatenations are turned OFF via [`infr_core::backend::Backend::capabilities`], so the runner takes the
//! classic host-embed + host-sample static path over SEPARATE q/k/v/gate/up projections — each a
//! cleanly sliceable weight + op. Generalizes to any world size `W` that divides `n_head`, `n_kv`
//! and `n_ff`; the all-reduce data path is `W`-general, only its ring/tree schedule optimization is
//! deferred (v1 does an all-to-all-ish exchange).
