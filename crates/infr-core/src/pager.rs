//! Generic, backend-agnostic block-paging bookkeeping: a fixed-slot LRU cache mapping an opaque
//! `BlockId` to a slot index, for any backend that wants to keep a working set of uniform-ish
//! byte blocks resident in a budget smaller than the full set.
//!
//! This module holds ONLY the host-side residency/eviction *decision* (no GPU types, no bytes) —
//! [`Pager::touch`] is pure bookkeeping, cheap to unit test without a device. A backend wraps this
//! with the actual VRAM arena + device LUT buffer + upload machinery (see `infr-vulkan`'s
//! `GpuPager`) and drives it by calling `touch` for every block a dispatch is about to read,
//! before recording that dispatch.
//!
//! ## Today: MoE expert paging
//! The Vulkan MoE lowering plugs in `BlockId = (layer, role, expert_id)` packed into a `u32` (see
//! `infr-vulkan`'s `pager` module) with a demand/LRU policy — an expert is paged in on first use
//! by a layer and evicted least-recently-used when the arena is full.
//!
//! ## Dense layer streaming
//! The second policy reuses the SAME slot bookkeeping for `BlockId = layer_idx` (or a per-tensor
//! block within a layer) in a dense model whose weights don't fit VRAM: a dense forward visits
//! layers in a fixed, known order every step, so residency is schedule-driven via
//! [`Pager::schedule`] (exact cyclic-sweep eviction, Belady-parity — see its doc) rather than
//! demand/LRU. The PREFETCH side (staging layer `l+1`'s bytes while `l` executes) is the
//! backend's job — `infr-vulkan`'s `DensePagerSession` records uploads ahead of GPU execution
//! through its pipelined ring; this module stays pure residency/eviction bookkeeping.
