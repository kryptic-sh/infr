//! Expert parallelism (MoE) — distribute a routed-expert model's EXPERTS across several physical
//! Vulkan devices so each device stores + computes only its own contiguous band of experts (a
//! capacity split + parallel expert compute), the per-token routing runs replicated on every rank,
//! and one all-reduce per MoE layer combines each rank's partial expert output into the full
//! weighted top-k sum. A DIFFERENT decomposition from dense tensor parallelism ([`crate::tp`],
//! which shards each dense weight matrix) and layer-split ([`crate::PipelineBackend`], which places
//! whole layers on whole devices): EP shards the STACKED EXPERT BANKS by expert and reduces once
//! per `Op::MoeFfn`.
//!
//! # Sharding scheme (comms-minimal — ONE all-reduce per MoE layer, ZERO dispatch traffic)
//!
//! * **Experts** — the stacked banks `ffn_{gate,up,down}_exps` are split by EXPERT: device `r` of a
//!   `W`-way world owns the contiguous band `[r·E/W, (r+1)·E/W)` (needs `W | E`). The binder uploads
//!   only that band to rank `r` (capacity split — each device holds `E/W` experts' banks).
//! * **Router + everything else** (embeddings, attention, norms, the router GEMV + top-k, the
//!   residual stream, the LM head, KV) is REPLICATED and bit-identical on every rank. Because the
//!   router weight is replicated, every rank computes the IDENTICAL global top-k selection + the
//!   normalized routing weights — so all ranks agree, deterministically, on which expert every token
//!   wants and with what weight.
//! * **Per-band expert compute** — the [`Op::MoeFfn`] on rank `r` carries `ep_band = Some((r·E/W,
//!   E/W))`: it still routes over the FULL `E` (replicated router/top-k) but a `moe_ep_band_remap`
//!   right after top-k rewrites the selected global ids into rank `r`'s LOCAL shard indices
//!   (out-of-band → id 0, weight 0), so the expert GEMV/GEMM stages read only rank `r`'s bank and
//!   the weighted combine drops the assignments rank `r` doesn't own. Rank `r`'s MoE output `dst` is
//!   thus a PARTIAL `[tokens, n_embd]` — the weighted sum over just its band's experts.
//! * **Combine** — the partials are summed across ranks by an **all-reduce** ([`crate::tp_allreduce`],
//!   reused verbatim from TP): host-less P2P dma-buf data path with `VK_KHR_external_semaphore_fd`
//!   GPU-side ordering when the device pair supports it, else host-fence, else host-bounce. For each
//!   (token, slot) exactly one rank has a non-zero weight (the band owning that expert) and every
//!   other rank contributes a hard 0 (exact in f32), so `Σ_r dst_r` reproduces the single-device
//!   weighted top-k sum — differing only by reassociation of the cross-rank add (token-identical,
//!   exactly like TP). ONE all-reduce per MoE layer; the residual hidden state is replicated on
//!   every rank (attention/norms run replicated), so there is NO separate dispatch of activations —
//!   only the combine crosses the bus.
//!
//! # How it stays invisible above the [`Backend`] seam
//!
//! Exactly like [`crate::tp`] / [`crate::PipelineBackend`], the model runner (`generate_dense_backend`)
//! drives this as ONE backend over the ordinary single-device graph. At [`ExpertParallelBackend::execute`]
//! the graph is LOWERED once (cached in the plan) into per-rank graphs (expert-bank decls shrunk to
//! the band, each `Op::MoeFfn`'s `ep_band` set to the rank's band) and partitioned into SEGMENTS cut
//! after each `Op::MoeFfn`. Each segment runs on every rank; after a segment the MoE `dst` partial is
//! all-reduced so the following residual `Add` reads the full sum identically on every rank.
//!
//! # Scope (v1, correctness-first)
//!
//! One MoE arch (qwen3moe: split gate/up, softmax gating, `norm_w`, no shared expert), `W`-general as
//! long as `W | n_expert`, experts RESIDENT (no pager) on each rank. Deferred: shared-expert
//! placement (qwen35moe / llama4 `MoeSharedExpertAdd`), the paged expert path, DeltaNet-MoE /
//! gemma4-MoE / Scout, and compute/comms overlap. The GPU-resident decode-replay / embed-gather /
//! gpu-sample fast paths are turned OFF via [`capabilities`] so the runner takes the static
//! host-embed + host-sample per-token `execute` path (keeps the residual `hidden` a bound Input the
//! segment executor hands through) — the same lever pipeline/TP use.
