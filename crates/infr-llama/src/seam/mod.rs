//! CPU model runner — builds and drives the agnostic decode [`infr_core::graph::Graph`] through [`CpuBackend`].
//! The backend itself lives in `infr-cpu`; this module is the model-specific "glue" that
//! assembles the layer graph, uploads weights, and steps the KV cache.
//!
//! Split into submodules (pure move, zero behavior change): `weights` holds the per-layer
//! weight-handle structs and the persistent seam session state; `sc` holds the DiffusionGemma
//! self-conditioning pieces; `runner` holds the giant backend-generic `generate_dense_backend`
//! and its `DecodeHandles`. This file keeps the thin per-backend entry wrappers, the `verify_*`
//! family, and the small shared helpers every submodule reaches into.

/// rather than failing the load.
///
/// # Where the budget comes from
/// **Both call sites are already past the point where the model did not fit VRAM** — dense
/// streaming and the paged MoE cache are each only reached when residency was rejected — so
/// reaching here IS the signal that this run has to stream. An explicit `paging.dram` still wins;
/// otherwise the budget is sized from what the host can actually spare
/// ([`infr_core::hostmem`]), because a tier that is off by default helps nobody on the one run
/// that needs it, and the alternative is a user guessing a number that is worth 1.6x
/// (`docs/perf/results.md`).
///
/// # Forcing this path on hardware that would not take it
/// Auto-sizing never REPLACES the two knobs, because a machine big enough to hold the model
/// resident is exactly the machine you want to test streaming on. `INFR_CACHE` (`paging.cache`)
/// caps the VRAM paging budget, which is what forces residency to be rejected and this function to
/// be reached at all; `INFR_DRAM_CACHE` (`paging.dram`) then pins this arena's size instead of
/// letting it be measured. Both together are how every figure in `docs/perf/results.md` was taken
/// on a card that would otherwise have kept the model resident — e.g. `--cache 2g --dram 3g`.
///
/// # Unified memory has only ONE host tier, and it is the arena above this one
/// `unified` is `DeviceCaps::unified_memory` — an iGPU or APU whose "VRAM" IS system RAM. There the
/// arena above already sits in host memory, so a host tier beneath it would hold extra blocks in
/// the same RAM that the GPU CANNOT read directly: every hit would still be copied through the
/// staging ring, while the identical bytes spent on the arena above are read in place. It is not
/// merely double-counted, it is strictly worse than making that arena bigger. So auto-sizing
/// declines on unified memory and says why; an explicit `paging.dram` is still honoured, because a
/// user asking for it by name may be working around something this does not model.

    // dense model's per-layer weights (minus what must stay resident) exceed the budget, stream
    // them through per-(dtype, stride) arena pools driven by the exact cyclic-sweep policy
    // (`infr_core::pager::Pager::schedule`). One block = one weight GROUP exactly as `wload`
    // uploads it (fused qkv / gate_up concats are one block — the shared `fuse_*_decision`
    // helpers keep this enumeration and the runner's upload order from drifting). Embeddings,
    // lm_head, norms and biases stay resident: norms/biases are consumed by ops without weight
    // offsets and are tiny; token_embd/lm_head are read at every token edge, so streaming them
    // adds their full bytes to every token's PCIe bill with zero locality to exploit.
    //
    //   1. `INFR_CACHE=<size>` on a DENSE model — force EVERY streamable block through the
    //      streamer with that byte budget (deterministic test hook, same grammar as the MoE tier).
