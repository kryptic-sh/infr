All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `Gguf::open` now snapshots files into immutable memory before exposing tensor
  bytes, preventing later file changes from invalidating live references.

### Fixed

- Reject GGUF tensors whose encoded byte count overflows `usize` and model
  metadata with zero attention heads.
- Stop malformed pipe-format tool arrays from entering a non-progress allocation
  loop.
- Treat model JSON as a tool call only when the request offers a non-empty tool
  list.
- Publish graceful-shutdown state and its signal number atomically so
  interrupted CLI commands retain the correct exit status.
- Drop completed CPU spin-pool results when a sibling task panics.
