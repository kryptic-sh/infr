/// recorder's per-format kernel-name match arms `unreachable!()` at runtime if a format is listed
/// here without its kernel wired, which is the compile-adjacent failure mode for that side).
///
/// DELIBERATE EXCLUSIONS (these fall back to the looped id-GEMV expert path for prefill —
/// correct, just slower; this doc is the SSOT for why each stays out):
///   * `Tq1_0`/`Tq2_0` (ternary): the values ARE tiny signed ints, but TQ1_0's per-element

///     regions per 256-block) has no natural word-parallel nibble→int8 staging — the dp4a
///     staging loop would degenerate into the same scalar decode the idm fallback already does;
///     TQ2_0 would map, but no shipped MoE GGUF quantizes expert banks ternary, so neither earns
///     a kernel until one does.
///   * `Iq1S`/`Iq1M`/`Iq2Xxs`/`Iq2Xs`/`Iq3Xxs` (remaining grid i-quants): NOT ALU-impossible —
///     the original "grid gather + sign staging is ALU-bound" rationale was DISPROVEN by the

///     measured). These five stay out only because no audited MoE GGUF quantizes expert banks
///     with them (unsloth UD mixes use IQ2_S/IQ3_S/IQ4_XS + K-quants); each maps to the same

///     real model ships them.
